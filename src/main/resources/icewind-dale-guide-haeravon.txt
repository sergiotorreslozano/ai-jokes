o======================================================================o

Welcome to the HaeravonFAQs guide "Beating Icewind Dale in 456 Steps" of
varying length, complexity, and importance! Icewind Dale, residence of
Drizzt Do'Urden, and.. yeah, well, that's pretty much it. There's no
other reason this crappy area was visited for a game than to excite
Drizzt fan-boys. It's shameless, Black Isle, shameless. Anyways, this is
one of the Infinity Engine games made by Black Isle/Bioware at their
height, and there were really two types of games made using this engine.
Epic CRPGs that redefined the AD&D video game where you recruited a
party of lovable, timeless NPCs to thwart some great evil... and the
Icewind Dale games. To make an analogy, if I may be so bold, the
previously mentioned category (including games such as Baldur's Gate and
Planescape: Torment) were like Fallout... and the Icewind Dale games
were like Fallout: Tactics. Like how I used Black Isle games to compare
Black Isle games? Anyways, the Icewind Dale games are more focused on
the combat, the gameplay, the essentials, if you will, whereas the
others... well, have more story, character development, and... choices.
Not to put down Icewind Dale (too much), they're decent games, and
Icewind Dale 2 tries much harder than the first game, but it's about the
AD&D action more than the story, which... in an RPG makes it a little
shallow.

Anyways... Haeravon!-you say, you've gone through this game SIX times
already just for this FAQ, you've defeated Heart of Fury mode... what
the hell are you doing making a v1.03 update?! Well, this guide was my
first guide ever, which means it looked a lot like most of the other
guides out there-it was horrible. Poorly organized, full of typos,
nearly innavigable... so after writing a Mass Effect FAQ, I came back to
this guide and updated it, to make it more easy to follow. Huzzah!
Everything is good forever! Unfortunately, no. I did more FAQs and came
up with new (arguably better) organizational schemes. Most importantly,
my invaluable friend, Lee Kadel, who helped my superior Baldur's Gate
guides by playing through the game using those guides and nit-picking
every other sentence decided that he's going to keep it up and play
through Icewind Dale. You suggest that a guy buy one AD&D Anthology,
and all of a sudden he's playing every Black Isle/Bioware game, and
using your FAQs for them all! Anyways, despite the improvements made in
v1.02, under the threat of further scrutinty from Lee, I decided to
proof this guide-again-and determined that it did, indeed, need further
improvements. So... this new version is an update, anticpating an
update. Together with my reproof, and Lee's suggestions, this guide
might finally be up to the quality standards set by my
Fallout 3/Baldur's Gate guides.

Finally, since I bought the same, wonderful, anthology that I have
suggested to several others, I found myself in possession of a version
of the game that had the 'Trials of the Luremaster' dungeon pack. Since
I have access to even more material, I figured I might as well include
it and make this truly the ultimate Icewind Dale FAQ.

Using this FAQ							{INT002}
o======================================================================o
Below I will list some of my quirks, organizational methods, and various
other tidbits that will help you navigate this guide. For starters,
during the main FAQ I'll break up the various chapters and
organizational components of the guide with a large heading:

o======================================================================o
|								       |
|		              Large Heading  			       |
|								       |
o======================================================================o

During the FAQ, I'll break up different areas with a thick line:

Thick line
o======================================================================o

Multiple parts of a mission in the same area will be broken up with a
thin line. This breaks up the missions into a series of steps, and
limits how much unbroken text you'll have to read at once. Nobody likes
wordiness:

Thin line
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->

Of course, I reserve the right to break my own rules during the FAQ..
mostly due to being scatter-brained and working on the FAQ in shifts
over the course of time. Life and all. So cut me some slack. Besides,
this organizational scheme is mostly for consistency and ease-of-use.

Version Information						{INT003}
o======================================================================o
I have three copies of this game-the original two-disc version (with
no Heart of Winter) the Icewind Dale collection that included Icewind
Dale I and Icewind Dale II (each on two discs, included Heart of
Winter), and finally the Dungeons and Dragons Anthology-a two DVD
set released by Atari that includes Baldur's Gate (and Tales of the
Sword Coast), Baldur's Gate 2 (and Throne of Bhaal), Planescape:
Torment, Icewind Dale (and Heart of Winter and Trials of the
Luremaster), Icewind Dale 2, and Temple of Elemental Evil. This is,
as far as I know, the most patched, most complete version of the game
out there. You can check your version by bringing up the options
screen in-game and looking at the bottom-left corner of the screen. My
version is listed as follows:

v1.42 (062714)

Play-Throughs 							{INT004}
o======================================================================o
I have now completed a total of twelve playthroughs of the normal game,
the first seven were those around which the guide was written, whereas
playthroughs 8-12 were gear grinds so I could make the ultimate Heart of
Fury party. The twelveth and final playthrough was done in Heart of
Fury mode with my uber party.

On the first playthrough I only went to Yxunomei. For the second, I
played through  the entire game (most of the guide is a compilation of
the 1st and 2nd playthrough). The reason for this is simple, I didn't
have HoW until halfway through the first play through. I decided to
start over with the same party (and gear) after installing HoW to make
sure I didn't miss anything. Up until Yxunomei on the 1st play through,
I went through the game the same way every other player did. By the 2nd
playthrough, I had  two chances at the same loot for the first half of
the game. This gave me some specialized loot that I wouldn't have
obtained in one play-but most of this loot was inconsequential (seeing
as how it's from the first half of the game.) In the end, nothing I had
by the end of the game the first time was any better than anybody else
could get in one play through. I did a third, fourth, and fifth
playthroughs with my party to further fact-check and to provide more
examples of what loot might be found. I wont pretend that loot I found
is from one play through, but I will denote when loot deviates from one
play to the next. Bottom line, at the end of the guide you can see what
items I found and how far my characters got. I noted alternative drops
by noting (2nd Play), (3rd Play), (4th Play), or (5th Play) and the
items that were different.

The sixth playthrough was done eighteen months later during the first
reorganization of the guide. Since rewriting the guide was more
complicated than simply breaking up each area into smaller Sequences of
Events, I simply recreated my original party (having had the insight to
export them after originally creating them) and played through the game
yet again with a fresh party. This also ensured that I had a pure party
with only one games' worth of drops and experience to take on to Heart
of Winter. On that note, however, I played the game on the hardest
difficulty to maximize experience gains (and to test the waters in case
of a Heart of Fury run), and spent a much longer time leveling up my
characters in the third level of Dragon's Eye to make the slightly more
potent Fighter 12 dual-class on my Fighter/Thief and Fighter/Mage
instead of the traditional Fighter 9 dual-class.

The seventh playthrough for this guide saw me starting over with a new,
ultra power-gamey party. It was around this playthrough that the guide
was fully revised for a second time, in an attempt to bring it up to the
standards set by my Baldur's Gate 1 and Baldur's Gate 2 guides. It's
also the first time I bothered to actively 'item fish'-or hunt for the
best of the random item drops. Since this involved some save/loading, I
found multiple of instances of new gear that I had never found before.
This is denoted during the guide with the (7th Play) notation in front
of the item found. If I found multiple new items, they were noted as
(7-x Play), (7-xx Play), etc.

Party Roster and EXP 						{INT005}
o======================================================================o
Keep in mind, characters lower on the party roster will receive less
experience than characters towards the top. When Icewind Dale has to
round experience, it gives the left over to the first character(s). This
tends not to be an issue later in the game, as higher, even numbers tend
to round easier. It's not much of a difference. At 200,000 experience,
the difference between the first and last character's EXP was 603.

Experience Cap/Level Cap					{INT006}
o======================================================================o
In the original Icewind Dale you could reach a total of 1,800,000
experience points. Pretty standard stuff, nothing complicated. However,
with Heart of Winter installed the experience caps have been..
altered. The level caps (as restricted by the 1,800,000 experience cap)
for the original Icewind Dale are listed below.

                       	o==========o
			| Icewind  |
			|   Dale   |
			o==========o

Paladin			|    14    |
Ranger			|    14    |
Thief			|    18    |
			o==========o

The experience cap for all single-classed characters in Heart of Winter
is 8,000,000. On top of that, however, the game has a hard level cap of
30. Once you reach level 30 your next level requirements will become
'GODHOOD'. For dual-classed characters, the experience cap is 8,000,000
for each class. Since dual-classing relies you surprassing your first
class's level with your second class, the uber power-gamey thing to do
his hit level 29 in your first class and level 30 in your second class.

For all multi-classed characters, the experience caps can be much
higher-but the same level cap of 30 is in place.. albeit for each
class. For example, a Fighter/Thief can get a total of 11,000,000
experience, but they will stop progressing as a Thief at level 30.
The experience caps for each class are listed below:

			o===============o
			|Heart of Winter|
			|Experience Caps|
			o===============o
Mage			|   8,000,000	|
Fighter			|   8,000,000	|

Items 								{INT007}
o======================================================================o
I'll list items found in containers-bookshelves, chests, environmental
bodies, etc. in the ***ITEMS*** section, I'll also list the (x=, x=)
coordinates the container is found at. The container could be quite
large, but I try to find areas in the 100s or at least the 10s if
possible. For example, I wont give you (x=1996, y=217) when I could give
the coordinates (x=2000, y=200). Some items in chests may be variable,
between patches items certainly change, but also different play throughs
can yield different results in the same container. Gold is always
variable, so I'll just give the gold I found, this should give a general
idea of what amount of gold you'll find, if not the exact amount. Also,
enemies drop different items in different play throughs. For example,
in one game an orc named Uligar dropped The Merry Short Horn, in another
he dropped a shield called Stoutward. The armored skeleton Therik
dropped a Ring of the Warrior first time through, and a Phase Dagger on
the second. I'll record what I found, but you shouldn't be surprised if
you find something different. If you are not playing HoW you WILL find
different items.

Note: In HoW you can highlight interactable objects in the environment
by holding down the 'Alt' key.

Item Fishing							{INT008}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
It's like fishing-but for items! Also, beer, water, boats, and hooks are
optional (if somebody sends in a picture of them fishing for items on
Icewind Dale while really fishing.. well, then I'll love them forever.)
Anyways, if you read above you know that item drops in Icewind Dale are
very random. Sometimes, the difference between one random drop and
another can be rather outstanding-the difference between a weapon that
you'll use for half the game, or a scroll you'll never care about, for
example, or a weapon that is a great improvement for one of your
characters, or one that you'll never use. If you could but just find a
way to get all the good loot when it really mattered.. Good news! You
can! Items are random-but they're randomly generated when you enter an
area (AR####) where the container or creature carrying the item is
located. All you have to do is save before entering the area, go in,
see if the item in question is the one you want, and if not, reload. I
call this process Item Fishing (call it Item Grinding if that suits you
better). When there's a great disparity in item quality, I'll note it
within the ***ITEM FISHING*** section. This will typically be noted
BEFORE you enter the area where the item can be found (there's no point
in letting you know AFTER you enter the area, and hence lock the drop,
is there?) Again, I won't do this for every random drop (there are far
too many), but only the ones I find significant.

If you have the Infinity Explorer program, you can check what items are
in containers without running to them. To do this, you'll need to enter
the said area, which will cause it to generate the loot. Save your game,
then open Infinity Explorer. Expand the 'Multiplayer savegames' folder,
then expand the saved game in question. Expand the 'Areas' folder,
then pick the (AR####) of the area you're searching for. Expand the
'Containers' option, then look for the container in question-the program
doesn't give any (x=, y=) coordinates, so you'll need to know what the
container looks like (or know what loot is in the container you're
looking for, and here my guide may actually help you.) Switch to the
'Items' tab, and if the item is listed in the container's inventory,
you're gold. Go get it. If not, you'll need to reload a save from before
you entered the area and try again. As far as I know, there's no way to
check the random drops of NPCs.

Traps 								{INT009}
o======================================================================o
I list the location of traps in a section similar to the items section.
Except it's wisely called ***TRAPS***. I didn't bother recording what
sort of trap it was, I intended to disarm traps I come across, and
frankly, it's just too much of a bother determining the sort of trap.
If you think you can figure out how to use traps to cause collateral
damage, that's fine with me, I'll point as many out to you as I found.

Quests/Rewards							{INT010}
o======================================================================o
When you get a quest reward, I'll note this under the ***REWARD***
section. Some of these are story-line and therefore obligatory. Others
are optional. Either way, the experience gained from completing quests
tends to be well worth the bother. So long as you follow the Sequence of
Events, you shouldn't miss any of the quest rewards. Whether you choose
to actually complete a quest in a rewarding fashion is another story.

HoW AI 								{INT011}
o======================================================================o
The HoW expansion seems to make baddies more aggressive. Some hit-n-run
tactics simply don't work well anymore, as the computer will manage to
hound you pretty effectively at times. Just keep in mind that you're
less likely to be chased far by non-expansion IWD monsters.

HoW Conjurer 							{INT012}
o======================================================================o
Originally, it seemed like a good idea to specialize my Mages into
Conjurers. They get extra make-em-go-boom spells, and they lose high-end
divination. Phhbt. Unfortunately, in HoW Black Isle decides to change
a Conjurer's limitation from divination to Invocation. This takes away
a good number of the Conjurer's offensive spells, and really isn't worth
the trade off. For HoW, stick to plain Mages.

HoF Mode 							{INT013}
o======================================================================o
Heart of Fury Mode is essentially the 'ultra hard' difficulty for the
game which gives monsters massive amounts of Hit Points and better
combat stats (lower Armor Class, higher THAC0, etc). On the plus side,
they give much more experience (you can expect 2060 experience from
Goblins in Easthaven at the beginning of the game.) When you activate
Heart of Fury mode the game is also set to the hardest difficulty
setting-Insane difficulty. By itself, Insane difficulty causes monsters
to deal more damage, and it adds new monsters to the game, which you
won't see on normal difficulty. Since the two are activated together,
I don't bother noting what's unique to Heart of Fury, and what comes
from Insane difficulty-I only focus on Heart of Fury mode, which is the
hardest difficulty and encompasses Insane difficulty anyways. If you
want to get more out of Icewind Dale, play Heart of Fury mode, but be
prepared for a struggle. You should at least have gone through the game
once (including Heart of Winter) before starting Heart of Fury mode..
and ideally, you should have performed several runs through the game to
get the best loot drops possible, painstakingly ensuring that you get
the best gear in the game before tackling Heart of Fury.. including
several copies of normally unique loot. I will note changes to enemies
and tactics in Heart of Fury mode under the ***HoF*** heading.

Activate Heart of Fury mode via the configuration utility for the game,
which can be found in the directory in which Icewind Dale was installed.
For example, the anthology installs to:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Atari\DnDMC\Icewind Dale

The normal version of the game installs to:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Black Isle\Icewind Dale

HoF Tips							{INT014}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Here is a list of (hopefully) helpful tips and tricks for making it
through Heart of Fury Mode.

  -->	Don't bother trying until you've beaten the game at least once.
	This includes the Heart of Winter expansion, where you can score
	several Gauntlets of Ogre Power.

  -->	Play very strong characters. Each character should be able to
	stand up for themselves in combat, and really, this excludes the
	use of my Thief/Mage (who has hence been replaced by a
	Fighter/Mage/Thief). Also, make use of multi-or-dual classed
	characters. You should ideally be over 3,000,000 experience by
	the time you start Heart of Fury mode, and playing a character
	who is going to max out at level 30 any	time soon is a waste.

 -->	Have very good gear, including multiple copies of otherwise
	'unique' gear. This makes multiple play-throughs necessary,
	unless you harvest the best gear from a play-through by
	exporting your Heart of Fury party individually equipped to the
	max from another playthrough.

  -->	Dispense with spells that have a Hit Dice or Hit Point
	threshold. Monsters have ridiculous hit points in Heart of Fury,
	and Spells like	Power Word: Kill are useless.

  -->	Don't rely on damaging spells either. A 10d6 Fireball is much
	less useful than a Chaos spell. Disabling enemies is far more
	effective than damaging them. Spells like Slow, Confusion,
	Chaos, Greater Command, and Symbol of Hopelessness are your
	best friends.

 --> 	Buffs will save your life in Heart of Fury mode-the difference
	between an unbuffed party and a buffed one is rather radical,
	especially if you follow my advice and are set up to make the
	most of spells like Haste, Stoneskin, Righteous Wrath of the
	Faithful, and Draw Upon Holy Might.

  -->	Don't rely on archers as much in Heart of Fury. A hasted, high
	level Fighter with grand mastery will take a while to put down
	weak enemies. In the realm of missiles, this translates to a lot
	of ammunition-honestly it's just a pain to bother running back
	to town to get more arrows, which you'll need to do almost
	constantly.

  -->	Take it slow, when possible. Enemies won't go down quickly in
	Heart of Fury, and a few enemies can be a handful. This is
	especially annoying when we start dealing with mages, Trolls,
	and enemies with damaging auras, like Salamanders.

  -->	Give Mages special attention. With our saves, the chances of a
	Cleric blasting us with a spell are miniscule, but most
	offensive Mage spells will hurt regardless of whether you save
	or not. The first time you get blasted by a 40-damage MagiC
	Missile or a 120 damage Cone of Cold, you'll get the point.

  -->	Play good characters. You'll be able to wear the Shimmering
	Sash, which will give you a three-point Armor Class boost. It
	matters. You'll also be able to use Three White Doves and the
	Blessed Helm of Lathander.

  -->	Play Humans, Elves, or Half-Elves. If you dual-class, you'll
	have to play Humans, if you multi-class, choose Elves or Half-
	Elves. I don't care if you don't like Elves, or if you think
	it's retarded to play a fantasy game as Human-use Dalekeeper to
	change your avatar and pretend you're the chosen race. All these
	races can wear the cloak Wailing of Virgins, and Elves and
	Half-Elves can use the Argent Shield. Gnomes and Halfings can
	wear the Trusted Defender helm-but Blessed Helm of Lathander is
	a decent compromise, and with the other two items.. it's a much
	better option.

  -->	Enemies with the Heart of Winter expansion installed like to go
	after presumed 'weak links'. This typically means your
	Fighter/Mage or Fighter/Thief/Mage. Punish them for their
	presumption by boosting said characters with Stoneskin. At
	level 17, our Fighter/Thief/Mage can negate a dozen attacks with
	a fourth-level spell. Enemies hit harder, not more, in Heart of
	Fury, and making strong enemies (who think they're being sneaky
	by attacking the Mage) waste attacks is good fun.

  -->	To get ready for Heart of Fury mode, you will need to do six
	runs through the main game to get all of the best Mage scrolls.
	Tenser's Transformation is not, unfortunately, anywhere near
	the beginning of the game. This also allows you to get multiple
	copies of some of the best loot in the game, like the Shimmering
	Sash, the Blessed Helm of Lathender, The Argent Shield, the
	Black Wolf Talisman, and so forth.

  -->	Undead are cheese in Heart of Fury mode-provided you have a
	high-level Cleric. The developer's boosted the Hit Points of
	undead.. but unfortunately for them, the Cleric ability 'Turn
	Undead' doesn't check Hit Points-it checks Hit Dice. A high-
	level Cleric will be able to walk into a horde of undead and
	destroy them all in a single round. This even works on some of
	the stronger types of undead, like Greater Mummies, and it will
	vastly improve your killing rate and make life easier for you
	through the whole game. In fact, about half the enemies in the
	game are undead! If you've built a party like mine-with five
	Fighter/Mage/Clerics, you can have them cast Invisbility on
	themselves, and walk around undetected, smiting every foe in
	the level. It's a mindless but devastatingly effective tactic.

  -->	Again, praising my own party: Having five Fighter/Mage/Clerics
	means I can start out any fight against troublesome living foes
	with massive spell-assaults. Not much can survive five Symbols
	of Hopelessness.. flavor with Chaos or Slow, to taste. Also,
	the ability to cast spells like Stoneskin and Heal with almost
	every party member really makes it difficult for foes to melee
	me to death. It's as potent of a combination as you can get.

Gear Runs and Exporting						{INT015}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
If you're playing through Icewind Dale casually, it's a pretty simple
little game-if you make some dual-classed characters with high
attributes, you should have no trouble cutting your way through the
game. In this case, multiple playthroughs are-like in Baldur's Gate-
anathema. But unlike Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale has Heart of Fury mode,
which doesn't just give us great incentive-but actually requires us-to
do multiple playthroughs. Once we realize this barrier of cheese has now
been broken by neccessity, we should hold no reservations about playing
through the game multiple times. Get as far through the game as you
wish (if you can score the Blessed Helm of Lathender from the end of
Dorn's Deep, that's grand), go to the character record screen by
pressing 'R', then click the 'export' button. Name the exported
character something sensible, exit to the menu, click the button 'create
game' and once you're in the character generation screen click the
'import' button and select your exported character. You'll keep
everything except containers (gem bags, scroll cases, and potion bags),
your level, experience, Hit Points, equipment, and so forth. If you want
to be cheap, you can simply equip each of your characters fully with
all the premium gear before you export, which will allow you to get a
fully-equipped Heart of Fury party in one playthrough, which is much
more convenient time-wise (but you'll always have to live with being a
filthy cheater!)

o======================================================================o
|								       |
|		2nd Edition Dungeons and Dragons Mechanics	       |
|		       (Character Creation) {DND001}		       |
o======================================================================o
Below are some simple suggestions for creating characters in Icewind
Dale. Even if you're a veteran of 2nd Edition AD&D, you should probably
familiarize yourself with this section, as not everything made its way
from the books into this game.. and this section will tell you how to
make a super-awesome power-gamey party, which is entirely not the point
of the pen and paper game.

Composition 							{DND002}
o======================================================================o
You need a Thief, you need a Cleric, and you need a Fighter. In the 2nd
Edition system, dual-classing with human characters allowed you to get
multi-functional characters. You can be 'hardcore' and play with less
than six characters (A Fighter/Mage, Fighter/Thief, and Fighter/Cleric
dual combo would be more than sufficient.) The game is easy on the
normal setting, it can be made even easier by using certain tactics
(I.E. Fighter/Mage dual with Tensers, Stoneskin, Haste, Mirror Image,
and Greater Invisibility and a Ring of Free Action can win any fight.)
If you plan to play for Heart of Fury, however, composition becomes
much more strict-I'd suggest only dual-class (Fighter/Clerics,
Fighter/Mages, and a Fighter/Thief) or multi-class (Fighter/Mage/Cleric,
Fighter/Mage/Thief) characters, for maximum potency. You will be
spending a long time leveling up dual-classers, however, and multi-
classed characters are vulnerable early on. Since I am very power-gamey,
I've made a six-character triple-class party, five Fighter/Mage/Clerics,
and one Fighter/Mage/Thief. It's the strongest party in the game, I
think, and you don't really have to spend any time grinding.

Gender 								{DND003}
o======================================================================o
Gender in no way affects the game.. except for Llew's reaction late in
the game. The biggest draw for having a mixed gender party-there are
only so many portraits to go around. Unless you import your own. Get
your hands on some Icewind Dale 2 portraits-some of them are rather
nice. Also, they fit with the other generic portraits better.

Race 								{DND004}
o======================================================================o
Humans can dual class, nobody else can. The other races (particularly
Half-Elves) get the best multi-class options, and Elves and Half-Elves
can equip the best shield in the game-the Argent Shield. Gnomes and
Halflings can wear a very good (but not the best) helmet. I make
every character a Half-Elf, since everybody is going to be a triple-
classed character.

Elf:		+1 Dexterity, -1 Constitution

Halfling:	+1 Dexterity, -1 Strength, -1 Wisdom

Class								{DND007}
o======================================================================o
Nothing determines more about your character than their class, their
profession, their job, their role. While I don't suggest too much
diversity in the class department, I will at least cover all the
possible classes here.. albeit jokingly and mockingly. If you plan to
make a serious attempt at Heart of Fury mode, you just need to ignore
most of the classes in the game and stick with Fighter-based dual-or-
multi-class combos.

Dual-Classing							{DND008}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
To dual-class you must be a human, and you must be at least 2nd level in
the class you started out as to dual-class. You must have a 15 in the
prime requisites of your current class, and 17 in the prime requisites
of the class you want to change to. The prime requisities for each of
the four base classes are as follows:

Cleric:		Wisdom
Fighter:	Strength
Mage: 		Intelligence
Thief:		Dexterity

Once you dual-class the experience of your previous class will be capped
at the minimum required to meet the last level you attained, and it will
go inactive. You can no longer gain levels in this class, or use any of
the class abilities. The only thing you keep from that class are the hit
points, you lose weapon and armor proficiencies, skills, spells, THAC0,
and even saves.

You now begin advancing as your second class, following all its rules.
For example, if you were a Fighter and dual-classed into a Mage, you
would be bound by the weapon and armor restrictions of the Mage. You'd
have the saves, THAC0, proficiencies, and spells of a 1st level Mage,
but you'd have your Fighter Hit Points. Once your level in your new
class exceeds your level in your old class, your old class becomes
active again. You cannot gain experience in your old class, but you gain
back any previously attained abilties, weapon and armor proficiencies,
skills, spells, THAC0, and saves, if they are better than what you have
now. A good tactic is to start out as a Thief and gain their Find Traps
skill, get it as high as you need, and then dual-class into something
more useful, like a Fighter or Mage. This gets you the essential Thief
skill without having to waste an entire character on a class that,
frankly, isn't great on its own. Another option is to make a Fighter,
get up to a high level and attain its high Hit Points, THAC0, and maybe
even Grandmastery, then dual-class into something else to retain those
excellent combat stats to make a more 'hardy' version of that class.
The experience gained by the first class does count towards your total
experience, and hence towards the experience cap. If you dual-class a
character, be sure to dual class early enough so you have enough
experience left to exceed your previous classes' level with your new
class. If you never exceed your first class with your second, it will
never become active, making the whole process a waste and stunting your
character. That said, the best dual-class combo is the Fighter dual-
class, as it stiffens up any other class prior to dual-classing. For
this you only really need nine Fighter levels to get the best bonuses
out of the combo, including nine levels of optimum THAC0, 9d10 Hit
Points, and enough proficiency points to attain Grand Mastery in any
one weapon. Also, since you can get 8,000,000 experience with Heart of
Winter installed, there's no real danger of failing to overcome your
first class' level with your second class unless you just utterly lack
common sense.

Speaking of not having any common sense, you should always start as a
single-class Fighter whenever you plan to involve a Fighter in a dual-
class. I mean, you only get the Hit Points of the class you start out
with (up until level nine).. why pass up the Fighter's supreme d10?
Besides, dropping a spell-casting class to pick up anything else is
tricky-the whole point of being a spell-caster is to cast spells,
without which you're pretty much capable of nothing. A Fighter who
loses Fighter levels will at least be protected by Hit Points. Also,
you should always try to pick a spell-casting class second (the class
you dual-class into). Spell-progression is determined by your level,
and to a much greater extent than almost anything any other class has
(a Fighter is done with uber Hit Points by level nine, and THAC0 by
level twenty, and a Thief will have all the Find/Remove Traps skill
score they need in a handful of levels). The best idea of all, of
course (which incorporates the other two notes above) is to find out
how much experience it takes to reach 30th level in your second class,
then get to as high of a level in the previous class before dual-
classing, for maximum power-gaminess.

Multi-Classing							{DND009}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Mutli-classing is a bit simpler than dual-classing. Most races besides
Human can multi-class into something, but Half-Elves are by far the
most versatile multi-classers. Whereas dual-classing means dropping one
class in favor of another, only to gain the benefits of the previous
class back after you exceed its level with the second class, multi-
classing means persuing both classes simultaneously. You get the better
choice of THAC0 and saves between the classes, meaning a Fighter/Mage
would use their better Fighter THAC0 instead of their worse Mage THAC0
or some composite. Hit points, however, are a composite, essentially
halving the dice rolls of both classes and giving them to you. If a
Fighter/Thief levels up in both classes, they get a maximum of eight
hitpoints (10 + 6 = 16/8 = 8.) Note, however, that if you are a Fighter
multi-class, you get the highest benefit of your Constitution, meaning
a Fighter/Cleric with a Constitution score of 18 would get a +4 bonus to
their Hit Points per composite level, instead of only +2 as a single-
classed character would.

Experience is split evenly between the two (or three) classes, which can
level up independently. This results in a slower rate of leveling than a
single-classed character. Multi-classed characters typically make up for
it with versatility, being able to effectively combine multiple class
abilties to maximum effect. After all, a Thief who can hide in shadows
and backstab with a Fighter's THAC0 and higher weapon proficiencies is
better than just a Thief, and a Fighter who can use Mage spells to spell
buff themselves with Mirror Image, Haste, and Improved Invisibility will
be MUCH more effective than just a Fighter. Since the experience cap is
vastly expanded for multi-classed characters there is no real limit to
how far they can advance in each class save your willingness to level
them up.

o==========================o
|Bard			   |					{DND010}
o==========================o
Hit points per Level:	d6
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Bards are rogues with a flair for the dramatic. They sing, they dance,
they cast spells.. they just aren't as good at the whole Thiefy thing.
Still, they suck in Icewind Dale for a variety of reasons, all of which
I will expose by comparing them to a Fighter/Mage multi-class (comparing
them to a dual-class perhaps isn't fair..) A Fighter/Mage will have more
Hit Points, better THAC0, better weapon proficiencies, more Hit Points,
and can reach levels 24/20, as compared to a Bard's 30. Since a Bard
can't dual-or-multi-class, there's just no hope for this class. Note
that in Icewind Dale Bards-for some reason-surpass the normal 6th-level
Mage spell progression. They can get up to 8th-level spells.. but the
higher-level Mage spells aren't anything to get excited about in
Icewind Dale.

The Cleric is a spell caster who is more melee-capable, with mostly
defensive, healing, and status-affecting spells. They might not have
the sheer versatility of a Mage, but they've got a number of great
spells. You'll need healing, disease and poison curing, and the extra
spell-power is nice. In fact, in Heart of Fury mode, Heal and Symbol of
Hopelessness are necessities. Clerics also gain the ability to 'Turn
Undead'. Essentially this ability pits the Cleric's level against an
undead creature's Hit Dice, and the better the Cleric compares, the more
likely they'll be able to turn-or even outright destroy-undead. This is
a passive ability, so if you were.. say.. under the effects of an
Invisibility spell, you could walk right into a horde of undead and
obliterate them without anyone ever being any wiser. Despite all that,
however, I don't suggest making a single-classed Cleric-or any single-
classed characters, for that matter, even if the Cleric is one of the
more capable single-class options.

Note: Clerics may be restricted from certain spells, depending upon
their alignments. See [SPT002] for more information. Or.. just follow
my advice-play a good-aligned Cleric.

|Cleric/Ranger		   |					{DND012}
o==========================o
Thanks to some wise advice I recieved from my readers, my eyes were
opened to the merits of this class.. as they are. A Cleric/Ranger will
get both the Druid spell selection and the Cleric spell selection..
which is not very impressive in Icewind Dale. To be fair, this class
isn't bugged the way it is in Baldur's Gate (where you get unlimited
Druidic spell progression alongside your Clerical spells), in Icewind
Dale you only get access to whatever Druid spells your Ranger levels
allow (maximum of 4th level). This means the Cleric/Ranger will fail to
get the awesome 5th level spell Insect Plague.. if the extra (and
unimpressive) spell selection appeals to you, a Cleric/Ranger might make
a decent substitute for a Fighter/Cleric. I, however, would rather have
the Grand Mastery of a dual-classed Fighter/Cleric or the sheer
versatility of a Fighter/Mage/Cleric.

Note: Clerics may be restricted from certain spells, depending upon
their alignments. See [SPT002] for more information. Or.. just follow

Druids are a lot like Clerics, but instead of worshiping gods they are
typically animists and get their power from nature itself. How does that
matter? It doesn't really. Their spells are more nature-focused, and
honestly.. well, in most respects they're worthy of contempt when it
comes to divine spells. They gain access to the mighty Heal spell, as
well as the potent 5th-level spell Insect Plague.. however, one must
keep in mind that unlike the Baldur's Gate 2 Insect Plague, the Icewind
Dale version is not party friendly, and is a static, area-of-effect
spell that only harms creatures within the swarm. All in all, a Druid
is just not as good as a Cleric, as they don't get all the wonderful
buffs the Cleric does, nor can they employ the Invisosmite tactic, not
to mention slower late-game level progression (especially that level
13-14 hump) and limited armor selection.. Another downside is the fact
that Druids cannot be good-aligned, which prevents them from using the
Shimmering Sash, and prevents them from benefiting from the 'Righteous
Wrath of the Faithful' uber-buff, which depends on alignment conformity.

Making your own Fighter is the easy choice for the first game, and
frankly having a Fighter with 18(xx) Strength, 18 Dexterity, and 18
Constitution will allow you to muscle through this game, especially if
you grand master in a weapon. However, picking a Fighter is something
of a waste, considering most of the benefits of a Fighter can be
obtained by level nine. What the Fighter is, then, is the ultimate
dual-or-multi-class option, and we'll leave it at that.

|Fighter/Cleric		   |					{DND015}
o==========================o
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
You'll have a better Fighter than a straight Cleric, or a weaker Fighter
with Clerical spells, depending on how you view it. I always end up
making at least one Fighter/Cleric, as the benefits of having a
supremely melee-competent Cleric (and the necessity of having a Cleric)
make this the best option. Just be sure to specialize in Maces, Flails,
or Hammer if you're dual-classing, as Clerics can't use edged weapons.

Note: Clerics may be restricted from certain spells, depending upon
their alignments. See [SPT002] for more information. Or.. just follow
my advice-play a good-aligned Cleric.

o==========================o
|Fighter/Druid		   |					{DND016}
o==========================o
This combination works almost exactly like the Fighter/Cleric, except
that you will of course have Druid spells intead of Clerical ones, and
you will have the Druid weapon selection, which includes Scimitars, but
doesn't allow Hammers, Maces, and Flails. The difference, then, is
obviously the spells. Clerics get all the good spell-buffs, but both
classes get the ultimate healing spell, Heal. Symbol of Hopelessness is
an awesome debuff for the Cleric (the best debuff in the game, in fact)
and Creeping Doom is the best summoning spell. Having at least one of
each isn't a bad idea. The biggest downside is that a Druid is more
vulnerable than a Cleric-which makes regaining your Fighter levels
somewhat more difficult. Also, since a Fighter/Druid must be True
Neutral, it'll prevent you from using any good-aligned gear like the
Shimmering Sash.

o==========================o
|Fighter/Mage		   |					{DND017}
o==========================o
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
My favorite class, and one of the strongest in the game. You can't
wear armor and cast spells at the same time, but that's hardly an issue
in this game, where you have many ways to improve your Armor Class
without having to wear armor. Bracers of Defense are one obvious way,
while various robes are another. Your Armor Class in Icewind Dale can
approach Fighter-esque levels with a bit of pampering, and if you
dual-class as a Fighter to beef up before switching to a Mage, you'll
get an awesome hybrid character, able to tangle in melee, fire at a
range, or cast all the Mage spells you need. Sounds pretty good, right?
It should, but that's not all. In this game, the Mage spell Tenser's
Transformation is absolutely broken. Apparently the developers didn't
take into account the fact that the only characters who might use that
spell aren't single-classed Mages. When a dual-or-multi-class Mage
uses it, they gain all the same benefits-lowered THAC0, doubled Hit
Points, and an extra attack per round. Take a Fighter/Mage dual who
started with at least nine levels of Fighter, and you can end up with
a 300 Hit Point monster capable of shredding everything the game can
throw at you, and if you spell-buff before casting Tenser's, you'll
be nearly invincible.

o==========================o
|Fighter/Mage/Cleric	   |					{DND018}
o==========================o
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Ah, the triple-classer. With an experience cap of 22,500,000, this
character can gain more experience than any other character save the
Fighter/Mage/Thief (with whom they tie), and built correctly, they will
end up with 154 Hit Points, full spell progression as both a Mage and a
Cleric, and due to the very generous gear in Icewind Dale, fighteresque-
level Armor Class. If you thought the Fighter/Mage was good.. well,
you were right, but this is just as good-a Tenser's abusing powerhouse
who can also self-heal. The only downside? Dual-classing doesn't allow
you to attain Grand Mastery in a weapon proficiency. The ease-of-use
over a power-gamey dual-class character, however, and the versatility
makes up for it.

Note: Clerics may be restricted from certain spells, depending upon
their alignments. See [SPT002] for more information. Or.. just follow
my advice-play a good-aligned Cleric.

o==========================o
|Fighter/Mage/Thief	   |					{DND019}
o==========================o
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The Fighter/Mage/Thief acts just like the super power-gamey
Fighter/Mage/Cleric.. except instead of being able to fling out Cleric
spells, you can use Thief skills. All in all, the Fighter/Mage/Cleric
is stronger, but you need at least one Fighter/Mage/Thief to find and
disarm traps.. the sneaking doesn't hurt either. Also, the Thief is
capable of using a much greater selection of weapons than the Cleric,
allowing you to diversify your weapons and tactics much more. A
Fighter/Mage/Thief in essence works like a combination of the
Fighter/Mage and Fighter/Thief. Plus, you'll have the option to jump on
other spell-casters with pre-emptive backstabs, whereas the Fighter/Mage
cannot.

o==========================o
|Fighter/Thief		   |					{DND029}
o==========================o
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This class easily matches a Ranger's skill with weapons while having the
same quirks. Some important differences remain, a Fighter/Thief can
disable traps and backstab, while a Ranger cannot. This makes a
Fighter/Thief in my eyes a good bit more powerful than a Ranger. Sure,
the Ranger will have higher Hit Points and some minor Druid spells, but
a Fighter/Thief is just as good in combat, especially since they can
backstab. Start out as a single-classed Fighter, then switch to Thief
for all the Thieving skills you'll ever need on a phenomonal Fighter..
plus Backstabs! Of course, the Fighter/Mage/Thief gets all those perks,
plus the ability to buff/debuff with magic.

Ah, the Mage.. a versatile spell caster, your proverbial glass cannon.
They can't wear armor, and they have access to a poor selection of
weapons. On the other hand, they don't really need them. As long as you
can keep them from getting hurt, they can lay waste to your enemies
with their spells. Anything from damaging spells like Fireballs, to
support spells like Haste, or simple fight-winners, like Confusion and
Chaos, it's the Mages' domain. A single-classed Mage is somewhat
vulnerable, but a combination Fighter/Mage is strong in melee and in
magic! And if you use the Mage levels to cast Tenser's Transformation
with Fighter levels boosting you.. well.. you break the game. Speaking
of breaking the game, you can also choose to be a Specialist Mage.
Essentially you get an additional spell per spell level, at the cost of
not being able to cast spells of the opposition school. Originally,
the Conjurer was an excellent Specialist Mage, but in the patched
(Heart of Winter) version of the game, they switched the Conjurer's
opposition school from Divination to Invocation, making this not worth
the trouble.

Illusionist	Illusion		Necromancy
Invoker		Invocation		Enchantment/Charm,
					Conjuration/Summoning
Necromancer	Necromancy		Illusion

*The manual states that the opposition school of the Conjurer is
Divination, and indeed, the unpatched game works this way. However, to
stop exploitive power-gamers from cashing in on the extra spells the
Conjurer gets at the laughable trade-off of a few crappy Divination
spells, the developers switched the opposition school of Conjuration
from Divination to Invocation.

This class is honestly a waste, compared to the Fighter/Mage/Cleric.
Sure, they'll get the same Armor Class as a Fighter, but their THAC0,
Hit Points, and weapon proficiencies will be worse. So why pick this
when you can be a Fighter/Mage/Cleric?

<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
At first, I advocated using a Mage/Thief as a decent way to gain a party
Mage and the thieving skills we'll need to survive.. it required an
obscenely long buff-session to achieve without leaving my party
vulnerable to buffs, but considering the experience constraints..
Anyhow, once I installed Heart of Winter, my 1,800,000 experience cap
was raised to 8,000,000, and experience stopped being an issue. Also,
since 9th-level Mage spells suck, I see no reason to create a character
just to cast them. On the other hand, the benefits of a
Fighter/Mage/Thief over the Mage/Thief are numerous-lower THAC0, more
Hit Points, better weapon proficiencies, and the ability to use Long
Bows and wear helmets. That being the case, this has become my solution
for my party's Thief problem. Having a good archer and extra spell-
caster is a welcome bonus.

Paladins are holy warriors, and as such they gain a slew of abilities
to help them combat evil. They aren't as combat savvy as Fighters, only
being able to buy two ranks in any weapon proficiency, and they cannot
multi or dual class. In exchange you'll get the ability to lay on hands
(heal a character 2 Hit Points per level), detect evil (useful for
telling which NPCs are bad or not and detecting enemies on the map
before you even scout), protection from evil, and they can turn undead
as if they were a Cleric two levels lower than their Paladin level.
Paladin's make great party leaders due to their high minimum charisma
(17). Still.. When it comes to the choice between NPC reactions and
having a superior character like a Fighter/Cleric or Fighter/Druid dual-
class, or a Fighter/Mage/Cleric multi-class.. well, it's really hard to
sell the Paladin, isn't it?

Rangers are defenders of the wilderness, hunters, scouts, and
outdoorsmen. They can only get two ranks in a weapon proficiency, but
in compensation they can use stealth, charm animals, and eventually
cast Druid spells. The stealth ability can only be used in light armor,
Leather, Studded Leather, or Hide, but it makes them invaluable for
scouting ahead of the party. Being strong enough to fight their way out
of trouble helps too. The charm animal ability sucks, but once in a
while if you want to play with it and charm a bear or something.. eh..
they'll still turn hostile on you when it's over, so why bother? The
Druid spells are a long time in coming, but it's somewhat nice to be
able to cast Heal and Insect Plague.. if you reach obscene experience
levels. Or you could just make a Fighter/Mage/Thief and cast better
spells.

The Thief isn't as combat savvy as the Cleric, and they don't have
spells. What's the draw then? Their thieving abilities. These allow them
to pick pockets, find and disarm traps, open locked objects, and hide
from enemies. Of these skills, one is essential, so some character or
another with thieving abilities is required in any party. As for combat,
they can only wear the lightest armors, but they do have access to a
variety of weapons. Most importantly, as they gain levels they get the
ability to 'backstab'. If they are hidden and attack an enemy they
multiply the damage they deal by their 'Backstab Multiplier', which can
do up to five times normal damage. They are a waste of a class on their
own, but it is a great dual-or-multi-class option, as it gives any class
the ability to be more lethal by backstabbing. You can find out more
about Thief Abilities in [DND048].

|Thief/Cleric		   |					{DND026}
o==========================o
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Well, might as well mention it eh? The Thief/Cleric is an odd, and at
odds character. You won't be wearing any heavy armor if you want to keep
your Thief skills, but you can certainly wear light armor with no
problem. Of course, you're stuck with the Cleric's selection of weapons,
but you'll be able to use all the Thief skills, including backstab.
Honestly the Mage spells seem a better fit for a Thief, which is more of
a 'stay back out of the way' kind of class, as opposed to the Cleric,
which is often a decently armored character who can stand up in combat.
This might be an interesting dual-class, provided you don't care that
your Cleric won't be as tough as if you had dual-classed with a Fighter.

Note: Clerics may be restricted from certain spells, depending upon
their alignments. See [SPT002] for more information. Or.. just follow
my advice-play a good-aligned Cleric.

Alignment 							{DND027}
o======================================================================o
Some equipment cannot be used by some alignments, and if you're a
Cleric, your alignment will determine what spells you can cast. Also,
a few dialogue options differ depending on your alignment (which I try
to note as much as possible throughout the guide). There is, however,
a clear consensus in terms of power-make a party full of good-aligned
characters. One of the best Maces in the game cannot be used by evil
characters, and the best belt in the game requires you to be good-
aligned. Both of these are items that make it onto my characters in
Heart of Fury mode, so they are not to be discarded lightly. Also, an
evil Cleric cannot cast Heal-a huge prohibition. Good Clerics lose out
on Harm and Destruction, nice spells, but not essentials like Heal.
Neutral Clerics cannot cast many of the higher level alignment-based
spells (but they can cast all the lower-level spells from either
alignment. See [SPT002] for more information on restricted Cleric
spells. Another spell, 'Righteous Wrath of the Faithful' is one of the
best party-buffs in the entire game, and it gives massive bonuses if
your entire party is of the same alignment. My suggestion? Make all your
characters Neutral Good. It'll pay off in the long run.

Abilities 							{DND028}
o======================================================================o
You can reroll your attributes and modify them, so why wouldn't you? My
friend and I are perhaps a little too anal with this process, but it's
not that difficult to make a killer party if you're not vain. Charisma
is a good dump stat, you don't need more than three points for anybody
but your party leader. If you have a Paladin, problem solved (they have
a minimum Charisma of 17.) EVERYBODY should have 18 dexterity. If you
don't, you're wasting precious Armor Class (Dwarves can only naturally
get a 17, but with luck you might find a potion to raise it, Gloves of
Dexterity, or Kaylessa's Gloves.) EVERYBODY should have at LEAST a
16 Constitution. If you are a Fighter (single, dual, or multi classed)
you should have an 18. That's extra Hit Points, and Hit Points are good
for live-staying. Most characters should ideally have an 18 Strength.
Unless you're making a straight Mage, or an archer, then who cares. This
affects how much loot (in weight) you can carry. A Fighter (single,
dual, multi) or any fighting class (Paladin, Ranger) should have
exceptional Strength of at least 18(91). 18 Strength gives you +1 THAC0,
and +2 damage. 18(91)-18(99) gives you +2 THAC0, +5 damage.  That's not
big, it's huge. If you are lucky enough to get 18(00) Strength, that's
+3 THAC0, +6 damage. Very desirable for a Fighter. Intelligence only
matters for Mages. If you have a Mage, they need an 18 Intelligence.
Period. If not, it's a great dump stat. Wisdom is most useful for
Clerics, Druids, and Paladins, the former should have an 18, the latter
will get by with the minimum of 14. Charisma is only important to Bards,
and even then, I have my doubts as to how crucial it is under Icewind
Dale's rules. One character should have good Charisma, and this should
be your party leader.

Note: These tables were all created based on information in the game's
.2da files.

Strength							{DND029}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
If you're a Fighter (single, multi, or dual class) or a fighter type,
you can get exceptional strength, which is a percentile bonus in
parentheses after the strength score. For example, 18(01-00) denotes a
strength of 18 with an exceptional range of 1% to 100%. A single-class
Fighter should try for as much Strength as possible. Ideally anything
from 18(91) and up is fantastic, as it provides a +2 THAC0 and a +5
damage bonus. If you are a Cleric, you might as well try for an 18 so
you can melee well. Regardless, any fighting class needs an 18 in
Strength. A Mage or a Thief that doesn't intend to melee can use this as
a dump stat. If you're making a multi-class character, don't sweat the
exceptional Strength. The higher, the better, but getting high scores in
your other abilities is more important. Weight is somewhat important..
as it'll reduce your trips to town if you can just carry more. Also, if
your Strength isn't high enough, you wont be able to wear some heavier
armor. Your bash % is your chance of forcing a door or chest; it's not
honest. Save/reload won't get you into a chest. Some chests/doors just
have a threshold you must reach, and your Strength will never be a
replacement for the knock spell or good old-fashioned lock picking Just
make sure that you get an 18 at least if you ever intend to melee.

In the expansion, Heart of Winter, you can get your hands on (or rather,
in) several sets of Gauntlets of Ogre Power, which will raise your
Strength to 18(00). There's also the Girdle of Stromnos in the main
game which raises your Strength to 19, but there's another belt which
would be better to wear.. especially considering that the difference
between 18(00) Strength and 19 Strength is one point of damage. That
said, both such items are fairly far into the game. If you are
fortunate enough to start out with 18(00) Strength, you can just go
ahead and wear the Gauntlets of Weapon Expertise, which give +1 THAC0
and +2 Damage.

Dexterity							{DND030}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This affects your Armor Class, and your THAC0 adjustment for missile
weapons. EVERY character should get an 18 Dexterity for the wonderful
-4 armor class modifier. Period. There are a few items that increase
your Dexterity, like Kaylessa's Gloves. These won't always drop in a
game, and one point really isn't much. It's best to just have an 18
Dexterity naturally.

are a Thief, of course. See [DND048] for more information.

Constitution							{DND031}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This gives you Hit Points. Hit points are good. Note that in the
'Hit Points per Level' column there are two rows of numbers listed-
the ones on the left-the lower numbers-are the Hit Points gained by
non-Fighters per level. The ones on the right are the Hit Points gained
by Fighters (single, multi, and dual-classed). Both only get these
bonuses from levels one-to-nine.

		o=======o===============o=======o

Note: In the Regeneration Rate column, what the hell do those numbers
mean? Well, they're a measure of the time it takes to regenerate a lost
Hit Point.. but not REAL time, no, that would be too simple-it's the
number of game-time seconds it takes to regenerate a lost Hit Point.
So for a Constitution score of 20, it takes 60 seconds-one minute-of
game-time to recover one Hit Point. One minute of game-time is 2.5
seconds of real time, so our rate of time-lapse difference is
60/2.5 = 24:1. This makes sense, doesn't it? It means that one hour
spent playing in real-time is one day of game-time. So divide all those
numbers by 24, and that's how many seconds it takes to recover a lost
Hit Point.

Intelligence							{DND032}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
If you're a Mage, get an 18, if not, it's a dump stat. By 'dump stat',
I mean lower it to 10 or so to put the excess points in other attributes
you actually need. 'Max Spell Level' refers to the highest level of Mage
spell you'll be able to cast. 'Max Spells per Level' is the maximum
number of different spells you can have in your spell book per spell
level. These factors will never be a deciding factor as you can simply
drink a potion to temporarily allow you to scribe more spells than your
spells per level allowance. In fact, you can just use potions in a
timely manner to scribe all the spells you wish, allowing you to have
as low of an Intelligence as you please regardless of your natural level
maximum or spells per spell level. Still, it's just more convenient to
have the natural Intelligence instead of having to rely on potions all
the time and scribing spells all at once. If you fail at scribing a
scroll, simply reload until you succeed. Lore is your ability to
identify magical items. You'll have plenty of Identify spells to make
this a non-issue.

Wisdom								{DND033}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
If you're a Cleric or a Druid, you want an 18. Otherwise, it's a dump
stat. For Clerics and Druids you don't have a spell level maximum for a
low wisdom in 2nd edition, but higher Wisdom nets you bonus spells.
Definitely a draw for single class characters, but if you simply cannot
spread your points out enough to get a great Wisdom, it's not that big
of a deal. If you're a triple-classed Fighter/Mage/Cleric, you have
tons of attributes you need to focus on, and of them, Wisdom is
probably the least important. A few extra 1st-4th level spells and some
Lore is not a big deal.

Charisma							{DND034}

Charisma affects NPC reactions to you and determines shop prices. Rarely
you'll get a better reward for having a higher Charisma. It's a dump

best discounts, make sure to have your character with the highest
Charisma as party leader when interacting with the shopkeeper.

Hit Points 							{DND036}
o======================================================================o
You run out of Hit Points, and you die. These are important.
Multi-classing averages your Hit Points/level across your classes. A
Fighter/Mage multi would gain 7 Hit Points a level (10+4)/2 - 5 Fighter,
2 Mage. A multi-classed character will still get bonus Hit Points for
having a Fighter class (up to 4), but a dual-class character can start
out 9 levels of Fighter, get all 9d10+36 Hit Points and dual class into
something else. This is in every way favorable. You should get max Hit
Points each level, and really, since I'm so anal with my attributes,
I'd just save/reload until I got it anyways (ala Baldur's Gate). Just
save yourself some time and click the button in the options menu.

THAC0 and Armor Class 						{DND037}
o======================================================================o
THAC0 is an acronym for 'To Hit Armor Class 0'. This is the roll on a
d20 (a 20 sided dice) that you'd need to hit somebody with an Armor
Class of 0. Statistically, each point is a 5% chance to hit Armor Class
0, and a roll of 20 is ALWAYS a hit, and a roll of 1 is ALWAYS a miss,
regardless of your THAC0/their Armor Class. Fighters get a lower THAC0
quicker (hence a better chance to hit) than other classes, and Mages
have the worst THAC0 progression. A lower THAC0 and lower Armor Class
are better-which seems counter intuitive, but that's 2nd Edition for
you. (Nostalgia for a moment here.) Having a negative Armor Class
essentially raises the enemies' THAC0. For instance, my Paladin has a
base THAC0 of 5 (-2 with all her proficiencies, Strength, the bonus on
the weapon, etc), and my Ranger/Cleric has an Armor Class of -13. My
Paladin would need an 11 on a d20 to hit her (-2 +13 = 11). That's a 55%
chance to miss-a 45% chance to hit. So, for a general rule, lower THAC0
and lower Armor Class are good. Unless the enemy has them. Then it's not
so good.

THAC0 by Class/Level*						{DND038}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
*This is taken straight from the 2nd Edition Dungeons and Dragon's
Players Handbook.

				LEVEL
 	1  2  3	 4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

  -->	Priest includes Druids.

  -->	Rogue includes Bards.

  -->	Warrior includes Paladins and Rangers.

Multi-class characters use the best THAC0 progression of either of
their classes-Fighter/Mages use the Fighter's THAC0 progression, and
Cleric/Thieves use the Thieve's THAC0 progression.

Dual-class characters use the THAC0 of their active class if they
haven't regained their bonuses from the previous (inactive class). If
they have, they use whichever gives them the best THAC0.

Armor Class Modifiers by Weapon Type				{DND039}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Different armor types are strong against different attack types. It
might seem like information overload, but keep it in mind when picking
between various types of armor. A suit of Leather Armor +3 versus a
suit of Studded Leather Armor +2 might both give the same armor class,
but because of the modifiers the Studded Leather is by far the better
choice. It comes up. Oh, and remember, in 2nd Edition AD&D, a negative
number reduces your Armor Class, hence making your more difficult to
hit, and a positive number increases your Armor Class, which is a bad
thing.

Saving Throws							{DND040}
o======================================================================o
There are some things that speed and armor just can't protect against.
This typically means magic, in some form or another, and really, a
Fireball doesn't care about your Plate Mail Armor. An enchantment can't
be blocked by a shield, and being fleet of foot won't stop a Lich from
using vile necromancy to rip the soul from your body. Nope, for that,
we resort to Saving Throws, needlessly sorted into five categories that
aren't always as self-explanatory as they seem to be. When your
character is forced to making a saving throw check against something,
they 'roll' a d20 and must exceed their Saving Throw. So like Armor
Class, the lower the better.

		o=======o=======o=======o=======o=======o

  -->	Priest includes Druids.

  -->	Rogue includes Bards.

  -->	Warrior includes Barbarians, Paladins, and Rangers.

Note: Multi-classed characters take the lowest Saving Throws offered by
any of their classes. For example, a high level Fighter/Mage uses the
better Fighter Saving Throws versus Paralysis/Poison/Death, and the
better Mage Saving Throws versus Rod/Staff/Wand.

Weapon Proficiencies 						{DND041}
o======================================================================o
Most classes-the non fighting ones, can only become proficient in a
weapon (one rank). This only means they do not take a penalty to hit
with that weapon. Fighting classes (Rangers/Paladins/Multi-classed
Fighters) can get up to two ranks in a weapon. Single classed Fighters,
however, can get up to five, granting them tremendous bonuses. This
takes until level 9 (fortunately, this is as far as you want to go for
hitpoints, too.) A character who becomes a grand master (rank 5) in a
weapon is far superior in its use than others. We're talking +3 THAC0
and three attacks a round-compared the +1 THAC0 of a two-rank character.
If you make a straight Fighter (or better, a dual classed Fighter) take
advantage of their proficiencies, and grand master. The game has many
good weapons, but Large Sword, Maces, and Great Swords are all very safe
choices.

Weapon Proficiency Perks by Rank				{DND043}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
These are the lovely bonuses you'll gain for building up ranks in a
weapon. This is why dual-classing Fighters who grand master in one type
of weapon is such a good idea.

Proficiency Selection by Class					{DND044}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Below you'll find listed the different weapon types in Icewind Dale, and
the classes who can use them. Note that there is an important difference
between Clerics/Druids and Mages/Thieves. Mages/Thieves are unskilled
in the use of many weapons simply due to a lack of martial prowess
(presumably swinging a club takes special training that swinging a staff
doesn't take..? And please, tell me why a Thief can use bows, but not
crossbows? Factually speaking, weren't crossbows easier to use than
bows? And why can Bards use EVERYTHING? I mean, nobody really believes
singing is really much of a career, but seriously?) Anyways, if you're a
full-time Mage or Thief, apparently you just can't be bothered to learn
how to use most weapons. Clerics and Druids, however, suffer from
religious prohibition, not lack of melee prowess. Smashing a critter's
skull with a hammer is just more dignified and less bloody than stabbing
somebody. Really, that's the explanation 2nd Edition AD&D gives. Druids,
however, don't have any qualms about cutting and stabbing, they just
don't like metal.. unless it's a scimitar or a dagger, which is somehow
okay, whereas an axe is not. Why is this distinction important? Well, a
dual-or-multi-classed Mage/Rogue can use the better weapon selection of
whatever other class they have. A dual-or-multi-classed Cleric or Druid,
however, cannot. Their religious restrictions apply regardless of their
martial prowess. Therefore, a Fighter/Mage has a more diverse weapon
selection than a Fighter/Cleric or Fighter/Druid. Wizards and Rogues use
the BEST weapon selection they have access to-theirs is additive.
Clerics and Druids can ONLY use the weapons not restricted by their
class, regardless of what other classes they may have.

Lore								{DND045}
o======================================================================o
Lore is a minor statistic that rates your ability to identify unknown
magical items. Bards have the best lore, but the identify spell is the
great equalizer. So long as you get a high enough lore on a character
to identify minor items that you receive a lot of (such as ammunition)
you're fine.

Note: For multi-classed characters, only the class that gives you the
MOST Lore actually counts. For example, at Fighter 10/Mage 11/Cleric 10,
my Lore was 43-three points per level from Mage (33) plus ten points for
18 Intelligence.

Lore by Class/Level						 {DND46}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Everybody Else	  1 Lore/Level
Mage		  3 Lore/Level
Thief		  3 Lore/Level
Bard		  10 Lore/Level

Mage Spells (Scrolls) 						{CHR047}
o======================================================================o
Mages get new spells from scrolls. To use this handy function, right
click on the scroll, and select the button 'Write Magic'. If you have an
18 Intelligence, you have an 85% chance to scribe the scroll, if you
fail, the scroll is lost forever. This is a save and reload heavy event.
It's a downright wicked 15% fail rate. If you get an item that improves
your Intelligence, you don't have to worry (also mods and sliding the
difficulty slider down will make this automatic.) You do NOT want to
lose scrolls, some spells only show up one time a play through. With an
18 Intelligence, you can learn 18 spells per spell level. Again,
increasing your Intelligence removes this barrier, but for 1st-3rd
level spells, some discretion should be taken. There aren't a whole lot
more than 18 spells in a spell level, but you don't want to risk not
being able to cast something yummy like Slow. Of course, you could
always use a potion to increase your Intelligence and scribe scrolls
then.

Also, Specialist Mages are extra focused in one spell school at the
expense of others. This means you get one extra spell per spell level
(HUGE BOON), but you cannot learn or cast spells from an opposed spell
school. Without HoW, becoming a Conjurer limits high-level divination
spells. The best divination spell in the game (there aren't very many,
either) is the 1st level Identify-which a Conjurer has access to. What,
then, do they lose? The 5th level spell Contact Other Plane, which is
actually a rather interesting spell. After HoW, they realized this is a
tremendous advantage, and made the restricted spell school Invocation
instead. Which is a much more severe penalty. At the end of the day, if
you have HoW installed, you probably just want to go normal Mage. Since
I'm multi-classing this playthrough, it's not a problem for me.

Thief Abilities							{DND048}
o======================================================================o
As noted in the Thief class description, Thieves have several skills
that are unique to them.. well, rather two of them are. These skills
are Pick Pockets, Open Locks, Find Traps, and Stealth. THe Bard also
gets the Pick Pockets skill, while the Ranger has Stealth. Every time
the Thief levels up, they may allocated twenty points into these
skills (Rangers and Bards progressed at a fixed rate as they level).
The Thief's race affects their starting skill scores, and their
Dexterity modifies them further, as follows:

Pick Pockets (max: 140%)					{DND049}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Pick Pockets allows you to.. pick the pockets of NPCs-as long as they
are not hostile. In practical terms, this means that the developers hid
a variety of items in the inventories of unsuspecting neutral or
friendly characters in the game, and without this skill, you'd have to
kill them to get the gear they have. Of course, even with this skill if
you fail to pick their pockets, they'll turn hostile. Since turning
quest-giving NPCs hostile can break the game, it's not a good idea. On
the other hand, if you save/load enough, you can steal any item.. so
long as you have a high enough Pick Pockets score, or failing that,
patience. Below is a list of the more interesting items you can pick
pocket in this game:

  -->	Amulet of Metaspell Influence
	Kuldahar, Chapter 1
	You can steal this amulet from Orrick (AR2102).

  -->	Amulet of Protection +1
	Wyrm's Tooth, Chapter 5
	Steal this out-dated item from Vera (AR7001).

  -->	Necklace of Missiles
	Kuldahar, Chapter 1
	Snatch this nearly useless necklace from Oswald (AR2108).

  -->	Ring of Free Action
	Kuldahar, Chapter 1
	You can steal this ring from Orrick (AR2102).

  -->	Ring of Free Action
	Kuldahar, Chapter 1
	You can steal this ring from Arundel (AR2112).

  --> 	Ring of Free Action
	Lonelywood [HEART OF WINTER]
	You can steal several of these rings from Purvis (AR9110) over
	the course of the Heart of winter expansion-every time he buries
	another body, he'll have another one of these rings. That's
	three, in total, that you can steal.

  -->	Ring of Free Action
	Castle Maluradek [TRIALS OF THE LUREMASTER]
	You can steal this ring from Harald, who is in the northwestern
	tower (x=9704).

  -->	Ring of Greater Resistance
	Lonelywood [HEART OF WINTER]
	Snipe this worthy ring from Kieran (AR9101).

  -->	Ring of Protection +2
	Kuldahar, Chapter 1
	You can steal this ring from Oswald (AR2108).

Open Locks (max: 130%)						{DND050}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This skill allows you to open locked chests, doors, or other objects.
Of course, a character with a high Strength score might be able to do
the same thing with brute force, and the 2nd-level Mage spell, Knock,
works on all locked objects this skill will work on.. making it another
not-so-necessary skill.

Find Traps (max: 115%)						{DND051}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Traps positively suck in this game (and in most games on the Infinity
Engine). Clerics can cast the 2nd level spell 'Find Traps', but they
can never remove them. Some traps are just annoyances-they occupy some
tile or container, and can just be avoided or ignored.. at least, if
you don't care about forfeiting the loot therein, and you have more
faith in your party's AI than I do. Then again, some traps just span
entire hallways, or are placed in front of foes. A Thief with this skill
is mandatory to deal with these issues.. although nobody said it had to
be a single-class Thief. Get this skill up to 100% as soon as possible-
it's the most important, and indeed, only essential Thief skill.

Stealth (max: 130%)						{DND052}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Another good Thief skill, this skill is called 'Move Silently' in game,
but is refered to as 'Stealth' throughout the 2DA files. Your Stealth
skill determines your odds of hiding from enemies-and unlike in later,
better editions of AD&D, this is an unchecked skill-succeed or fail,
it's entirely dependent upon your skill score, the enemy has no say in
the matter. You cannot hide from enemies on-screen (if they have a
line of sight to you, you can't hide, but if you break the line of
sight, you can) and lighting does effect your odds of success. Spells
like Invisibility duplicate this effect-and often allow you to perform
more actions (like searching for and disarming traps) without blowing
your cover, making this skill avoidable, but it still has its uses.

o======================================================================o
This section was added into the Icewind Dale FAQ because it seemed
like a worthy addition to the Baldur's Gate 2 FAQ.. and really, who
wants to skim through the walkthrough for information on the best spells
in the game when a kind FAQ-writer could just condense the information
and put it in it's own conspicuous section? Nobody, that's who. So,
here I'll discuss the spells: which are good, which are bad, and why.
To help you out and minimize how much you need to read, however, I'll
put an * next to the spells I find the most useful. Who wants to read
all that crap anyways? Just assume I know what I'm talking about and
read the marked spells and you'll be fine. If that's too much work for
you, however, I've also listed the top spells by level under the
***TOP SPELLS*** heading, with very, very brief descriptions of why the
spells are good.

Cleric Spell Alignment Restrictrions				{SPT002}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Some Clerical spells cannot be cast, depending upon the Cleric's
alignment. This will be noted after name of the spell, as follows:

[GOOD] Good characters can cast this spell.
[NEUTRAL] Neutral characters can cast this spell.
[EVIL] Evil characters can cast this spell.

If no alignment descriptor is noted, assume that all alignments can
cast the spell. A full list of restricted spells, by alignment, is
given below:

[GOOD]			[NEUTRAL]		[EVIL]
1st-Cause Light Wounds	4th-Cloud of Pestil.	3rd-Holy Smite
2nd-Cause Mod. Wounds	4th-Poison		5th-Champion's Strength
3rd-Cause Disease	6th-Harm		5th-Cure Crit. Wounds
3rd-Circle of Bones	7th-Destruction		5th-Raise Dead
3rd-Unholy Blight	7th-Greater Shield of	5th-Shield of Lathander
4th-Blood Rage		    Lathander		6th-Heal
4th-Cause Ser. Wounds	7th-Holy Word		7th-Greater Shield of
4th-Cloud of Pestil.	7th-Resurrection	    Lathander
4th-Poison		7th-Unholy Word		7th-Holy Word
5th-Cause Crit. Wounds				7th-Resurrection
5th-Slay Living
6th-Harm
7th-Destruction
7th-Unholy Word

As you can see, the good Clerics suffer more early on-but most of the
spells they can't cast are lame ones, like weak Cause Wounds spells,
Circle of Bones, and Poison. Neutral Clerics look like they have it
made, until they start being restricted from BOTH the best good and
evil spells. Evil Clerics really take it hard, losing out on Heal, which
is just one of the Cleric spells I cannot live without. This is on top
of not being able to use the Shimmering Sash and Three White Doves. So
despite their deceptively long list of prohibited spells, the good
Cleric is the way to go.

Healing Spells							{SPT003}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
I tend to have a subtractive, rather than additive view towards the
inclusion of healing spells in my spell-books. Healing spells are good,
nobody doubts that, but how many should you get? In my mind, it
depends by spell-level. Cure Moderate Wounds is clearly better than
Cure Light Wounds, but the competition for 1st-level Cleric spells is
much less intense than for 2nd-level spells. So, how do I determine what
to get? I get all the spells I want besides healing spells, then fill
up left-over slots with healing. Therefore, most of my 1st-level
Clerical spells tend to be Cure Light Wounds (with a token Remove Fear
on every caster, just in case) while on the other hand, I have almost
no Cure Moderate Wounds, as I'd rather have Resist Fire/Cold, Slow
Poison, and Silence 15' Radius. The only healing spell unworthy of this
second-class status is Heal, which is the ultimate healing spell, and
really, one of the best things about a Cleric/Druid. I have one or two
Entropy Shields, and fill up the rest with Heal. Another fun thing to
note about healing spells of all sorts is how much they speed up
resting times. If you set the options to 'Heal Party on Rest', you'll
use up healing spells during a successful (uninterupted) rest, rather
than waste eight hours for every Hit Point of damage you've sustained.
It doesn't affect story or anything, but some of my dual-class parties
looked really stupid with years of game time passed.. compared to the
more sensible 147 days my multi-class party took.

Summoning Spells						{SPT004}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
All summoning spells in this game are horribly nerfed, especially the
low-level ones. First, from a tactical stand-point, most of the things
you can summon will always be far, far inferior to what you're fighting.
Second, the number are rarely honest in the spell descriptions. Summon
Shadow and Animate Dead promise far more critters than they actually
deliver (I've never recieved more than three per casting), and second,
there's a cap on the maximum number of critters you can conjure. Six
total summons, and you can go no further. This means, in effect, that
the only summons remotely worth considering are the most individually
powerful ones-like Summon Elementals, Creeping Doom, Summon Monster VII,
and so on. Keep this in mind when you're looking over summoning spells.

1st-Level Cleric Spells						{SPT005}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Bless: Minor, short-lasting party buff.
  ---
Command: Causes one foe to sleep for one round, with no save.
  ---
Cure Light Wounds: Heals 8 Hit Points.
  ---
Curse: Minor, short-lasting debuff.
  ---
Remove Fear: cures and prevents fear effects for one turn.

*Bless
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Bless is a humble little buff that could see plenty of action. It gives
all allies in a 25-foot radius a +1 bonus to saves versus fear effects
and a +1 bonus to THAC0. The only downside? It lasts only six rounds,
so it won't be a spell I constantly use later on. It stacks with Prayer
and Recitation.

Cause Light Wounds [NEUTRAL] [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 8 points of damage on touch. Doesn't affect undead, constructs,
or extraplanar creatures.

*Command
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Puts a foe to sleep for one round with no save. It might seem paltry,
but if you can knock out that Ogre for one round, you've done yourself
a big favor. Obviously it becomes obsolete later on, and will not work
against undead, but for when you need it, it's dependable.

*Cure Light Wounds
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals 8 Hit Points.

*Curse
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Bless, but the opposite, it lowers enemy THAC0 and saves by one
point in a 25-foot radius. Again, at six rounds, it's duration means
it will not be an enduring debuff, but it's handy at first.

Detect Evil
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Shows you who the bad guys are. Of course, my definition of evil is a
little more flexible (it's probably that atheism thing, makes it so I
don't have any foundation for personal morality). Anybody who attacks
you, or has really good gear is 'evil' in my book, and worthy of
smiting.

Magic Stone
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
You enchant a small pebble, which can be slung at a foe, dealing 3-12
damage (6-24 if the target it undead). It's considered a +1 weapon for
determining what it can strike.

Protection from Evil
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A handy little personal buff that gives the target +2 bonus to Saves and
Armor Class and protects them from charm effects, like Charm Person or
Domination. There's a superior buff down the line for the whole party,
which makes this woefully obsolete.

*Remove Fear
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Removes all fear effects in a 30-foot radius and prevents them recurring
for the duration of the spell, which is one turn (10 rounds). A handy,
low-level, always-effective defense against fear, always keep one ready.

Sanctuary
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Gives the priest temporary immunity to prosecution by foes, during
which time he can heal/buff himself (but they cannot affect other
creatures without ending the spell). I don't see the point. If you're
getting hurt, retreat and cast a Heal spell. Why waste two rounds doing
what can be done in one?

2nd-level Cleric Spells						{SPT006}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Cure Moderate Wounds: Heals 11 Hit Points.
  ---
Draw Upon Holy Might: Boosts Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
  ---
Hold Person: Paralyzes one living, humanoid foe.
  ---
Resist Fire/Cold: 50% Resistance to Fire and Cold.
  ---
Silence 15' Radius: Shuts up spell-casters.

Aid
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Bestows the effects of Bless and heals 1-8 Hit Points. Since it only
effects one creature, I don't bother with it.

Cause Moderate Wounds [NEUTRAL] [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 11 points of damage on touch. Doesn't affect undead, constructs,
or extraplanar creatures.

Chant
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Grants allies +1 THAC0, +1 damage, and +1 Saves, imposes a -1 penalty
to enemy THAC0, damage, and Saves. Slows the movement speed of the
caster by 50% and prevents them from casting spells. Not cumulative with
other Chants. My multi-classers have better things to do than chant in
a fight.

*Cure Moderate Wounds
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals 11 Hit Points.

*Draw Upon Holy Might
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
For one turn it raises the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution of the
caster by one point per three levels. Since all of my front-line
Fighters are multi-classed Clerics, they will be able to boost all their
combat stats to 25 with this spell.. which in effect will give them
+2 Armor Class, +25 Hit Points (which double with Tenser's) and gives
them the awesome benefits of raising their Strength from 18/91+ to 25,
namely +5 THAC0 and +7 damage. There are only a few more potent buffs
in the entire game, and unlike most, this gets stronger as I level.
Sure, the duration is kind of ass, but the benefits are worth the
casting.

Find Traps
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Detects traps in a very close range. This spell doesn't disarm them,
however, so it's often rather pointless.

*Hold Person
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
An effective, low-level spell that paralyzes human, demihuman, or
humanoid foes man-size or smaller. While this doesn't affect most
enemies (undead, large foes, and non-humanoids make up most critters
in the game), it's still a decent low-level debuff. You're more likely
to see it cast at you, however. It affects one target, and all
immediately adjacent characters, and is negated by a successful Save.

Know Alignment
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Detect Evil, except it detects.. everything. Evil things glow red,
neutral things glow blue, and friendly things glow green.. like those
little circles under your feet!

*Resist Fire/Cold
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A handy spell that gives the target 50% resistance to cold and fire and
lasts one round per level. It's not absolute defense, but it's a simple
low-level spell that adequetly defends against the most common elements
in the game.

*Silence 15' Radius
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Silences all foes in a generous 15' radius who fail to make a Save vs.
Spells. Used in bulk, it can neuter enemy spell-casters with a high
chance of success-and a spell-caster without spells is just a blood-
filled sheath for your swords.

Slow Poison
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell is the only answer you need to poisonous foes-at least in
Baldur's Gate. In Icewind Dale, the spell simply doesn't work on the
most virulent of poisons-such as that employed by Phase Spiders and
Wyverns, for example. That being the case, I really can't suggest
bothering with it. Just use the 4th-level Neutralize Poison, instead.

Spiritual Hammer
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Conjures a magical hammer, which may be used as an implement of
righteous smiting. It counts as a +1 weapon from 1st-6th level, as a
+2 weapon from 7th-12th level, and a +3 weapon at 13th level and
beyond. It might come in handy early on.. but by the time my Clerics
are level three (and hence, can cast this spell) they already have
enchanted weapons. By the time they are 13th level (at the end of
Heart of Winter, or so) they already have +3 or +4 weapons that are
far superior.

3rd-Level Cleric Spells						{SPT007}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Cure Disease: Stops diseases from killing you.
  ---
Dispel Magic: Removes buffs/debuffs from foes/friends, ideally.
  ---
Holy Smite: Hurts evil people.
  ---
Prayer: Buffs allies, debuffs foes.
  ---
Remove Paralysis: Cures Paralysis in an area effect.

Animate Dead
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Thit spell summons weak undead, either Zombies or Skeletons, to do your
bidding. The line 'The caster can animate one skeleton or one zombie for
each experience level he has reached) is bunk. You'll summon three
critters when you cast this, and you can only have up to six. Six of
the weakest critters in the game.

Cause Disease [NEUTRAL] [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Touch a victim and you'll inflict a disease that saps 5-20 points of
Strength, which lingers for eight hours. Undead, constructs, and
extraexplanar creatures are unaffected.. which is most of the foes in
the game. It's not a terrible spell, but if you want to take a bad-guy
out of the fight, why not just use Hold Person?

Circle of Bones [NEUTRAL] [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Conjures a barrier of bones that harms all adjacent characters, dealing
1d6 crushing and 1d6 slashing damage. You cannot move during the spells'
three round duration. I'm not impressed by 6d6 damage, nor the whole
not moving thing.

*Cure Disease
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Diseases suck, and while the main things that cause them-Histachi,
Mummies, and Wraith Spiders-are all low-level monsters, you probably
would rather be able to treat those diseases rather than.. you know,
die. Always keep one handy on each character who can cast it.

*Dispel Magic
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Sometimes enemies cast bad spells that need to go-like buffs on their
allies, or debuffs on you. Chaos can win a fight for you, or end a fight
against you.. unless you dispel it. Fortunately, you won't be facing
many intelligent spell-casters, so the need to use this is much less
frequent than in the Baldur's Gate games. I still keep one handy at all
times on every spell-casting character.

Exaultation
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Removes the effects of fear, sleep, feeblemindedness, unconsciousness,
intoxication, as well as berserk and confused states of mind. It also
prevents them from occuring again for the one turn (10 round) duration
of the spell. Dispel Magic or Remove Fear works better for most of
these, and affects a whole party. By the time you're likely to encounter
Feeblemind, you can probably cast Heal, which is superior.

Glyph of Warding
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell creates a magical trap that-if triggered by an enemy-deals
1-4 damage per level to the unfortunate creature. Downside? The enemy
can save to negate all damage.

*Holy Smite [GOOD] [NEUTRAL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 1d6 damage per two levels of the caster (maximum 5d6, save for
half) to any evil creatures in the area of effect. If your entire party
is good-or-neutral-aligned, it'll be a party-friendly spell.
Unfortunately, the game is rather strict with what is considered evil.

Invisibility Purge
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Reveals invisible or hidden creatures in sight. This spell can be
handy on very rare occassions, but I never tend to bother with it.
There just aren't many creatures that use those spells/abilities.

Miscast Magic
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Forces a creatures to save at -2 or suffer an 80% spell-casting failure
rate. I prefer Silence 15' Radius, as it has a larger range and 100%
spell-casting failure.

*Prayer
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
An essential Cleric buff, it lasts one round per level and gives all
allies in a 60-foot radius a +1 bonus to THAC0, damage, and saves,
while all enemies suffer a -1 penalty to the same. It stacks with Bless
and Recitation. I tend to keep one on every Cleric, and cast it nearly
every fight.

Protection from Fire
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes the Cleric 80% resistant to fire. It can come in handy in a few
cases, but I prefer the utility of Resist Fire/Cold.

Remove Curse
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Curses do happen-usually through putting on cursed gear, or being
subjected to spells. The latter will go away on its own, the former
will not. Honestly, however, I never use this spell. Just Identify gear
beforehand and you'll be fine.

*Remove Paralysis
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Lots of foes cause paralysis in the game, and letting it go uncountered
is a good way to die. The spell's description is, again, bogus, but in
our favor. It doesn't remove paralysis from one character-it's an area-
of-effect spell. While I can't put my finger on how wide the area is,
I'd guess at least 20-foot radius. Always keep one handy on every
character who can cast it.

Rigid Thinking
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Confusion, but it only affects one character and has no save
penalty. Which is to say, it's like Confusion, but worse in every way.

Strength of One
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Gives the entire party 18/76 Strength.. which is a downgrade for me.
I don't want to debuff my party, so I don't cast this spell.

Unholy Blight [NEUTRAL] [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The opposite of Holy Smite, Unholy Blight deals 1d6 damage per two
levels of the caster (max 5d6, save for half) to all good creatures in
the area of effect. In addition, if they fail to save they suffer -2
THAC0, damage, and Saves for a paltry three rounds. Almost nothing you
will fight in this game will be good-aligned. This spell is garbage.

4th-Level Cleric Spells						{SPT008}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Cure Serious Wounds: Heals 17 Hit Points.
  ---
Defensive Harmony: Gives all allies +4 Armor Class.
  ---
Free Action: Protects against paralysis without negating Haste.
  ---
Neutralize Poison: Cure poison.
  ---
Protection from Evil 10' Radius: Long-lasting party buff.
  ---
Recitation: Party buff/foe debuff that stacks with Prayer.

Blood Rage [NEUTRAL] [CHAOTIC]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Targets friendlies and makes them go berserk. While berserk, they are
immune to charm, sleep, fear, hold, stunning, confusion, emotion,
symbol spells, and the like. The also gain +2 THAC0, +3 damage, +2
Strength, +10 Hit Points, and improved movement speed. While berserk,
your ally may well attack you, neutral characters, or otherwises just
attack things that need not be attacked. Also, you can't see their Hit
Points during the spell's duration, and they are fatigued when the
spell ends. Since this spell is antithetical to tactics, I give it a
frowny face of shame. :(

Cause Serious Wounds [NEUTRAL] [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 17 points of damage on touch. Doesn't affect undead, constructs,
or extraplanar creatures.

Cloak of Fear
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Causes the caster to radiate fear, forcing all nearby creatures to save
vs. spell or flee in panic for 2-16 rounds. I'd just use Horror,
personally, much better range.

Cloud of Pestilence [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creates a pestilental mist with a 20-foot radius. Everybody who enters
(save undead and the caster, who are immune) must save or suffer three
points of damage and are blinded. The blindness lasts a turn after
leaving the cloud.

*Cure Serious Wounds
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals 17 Hit Points.

*Defensive Harmony
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell gives all allies in a 10-foot radius a +4 bonus to Armor
class. The only downside? It only lasts six rounds. Use it as one of
the last buffs before entering combat.

*Free Action
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Gives the target immunity to mobility hampering effects like Grease,
Web, or Slow and negates the effects of Paralysis and Hold spells. Best
of all, it lasts one turn (10 rounds) per level-a high level Cleric
will keep this spell active for quite a while, indeed. Even better than
the best of all, it will NOT negate Haste! When Haste is involved, the
rules of good-better-best can be broken. If you want to be immune to
Hold, Paralysis, and those other mean effects, but keep your Haste, this
is an option for high-level Clerics.

Mental Domination
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Possibly the best charm-type spell in the game, this spell imposes a -2
save on the subject. I still never bother with it, as by this time my
Mages are chucking out better debuffs.

*Neutralize Poison
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
It's like the 2nd-level spell 'Slow Poison', except it actually works on
all poisons.. so why not use this, instead?

Poison [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals twenty damage over twenty seconds on touch, provided the target
fails to save. Little damage, over a bit of time, forcing you to touch
the foe, and it can be negated by a save. Neutral and good characters
aren't missing out on much.

*Protection from Evil 10' Radius
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Gives all allies within ten feet of the caster +2 Armor Class, +2 to
saves, and immunity to charm-based spells. Best of all, it lasts a
whopping turn per level. I keep one on every character who can cast it,
and tend to have it cast at all times. There's no good reason why you
shouldn't use it.

Protection From Lightning
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes a touched creature immune to lightning. You'll only likely face
lightning attacks at the beginning of the game (via spells like Static
Charge). You never really need to cast this.

*Recitation
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A truly great Clerical buff, it's Prayer on 'roids. Gives all allies in
a 60-foot radius a +2 bonus to THAC0 and saves, while all enemies take
a -2 penalty to the same. Prayer and Recitation work in tandem, too, so
I tend to use them in tandem. I always keep one prepared on each and
every Cleric.

Unfailing Endurance
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Restores 36 hours worth of fatigue-which should just about cure most
cases of fatigue. Of course, you could always just rest. If this was an
area-of-effect spell, it might be useful, but it's not, so it's not.

5th-Level Cleric Spells						{SPT009}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Chaotic Commands: Protected against mind-affecting effects.
  ---
Cure Critical Wounds: Heals 27 Hit Points.
  ---
Flame Strike: Deals 6-48 damage in a 5-foot radius. Troll killer.
  ---
Greater Command: Knocks many creatures unconscious.
  ---
Righteous Wrath of the Faithful: Massive buffs if same alignment.
  ---
Slay Living: Kills target touched if they fail to save.

Cause Critical Wounds [NEUTRAL] [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 27 points of damage on touch. Doesn't affect undead, constructs,
or extraplanar creatures.

Champion's Strength [GOOD] [NEUTRAL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The Cleric bestows the strength of their god and gives it to a target,
raising their Strength to 20-23 for one turn (10 rounds). The caster
is fatigued and cannot cast any other spells until this spell wears
off. What a load of shit. Why is Draw Upon Holy Might, a 2nd-level
spell, superior to a 5th-level spell? It's absurd. My party full of
triple-classers laugh at this spell.

*Chaotic Commands
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes a creature immune to magical commands-in effect, to mind-affecting
effects. It's one of the better Clerical protections in Baldur's Gate 2,
where such spells are thrown around liberally. In Icewind Dale.. it's
still pretty nice. If you have a choice, go with Mind Blank, as it lasts
longer, but there's still no reason to ignore this spell if you only
have so many Mind Blanks. Either one will do the job wonderfully.

*Cure Critical Wounds [GOOD] [NEUTRAL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals 27 Hit Points. The first healing spell that evil Clerics cannot
cast.. the future doesn't look good for evil folks.

*Flame Strike
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 6-48 fire damage to all foes in a five-foot radius, save for half.
It's a fair Troll killer, if you have too many 5th-level spell slots.

*Greater Command
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like the 1st-level spell Command, but it works for one round per level,
has a 20-foot radius, and the enemy can save against it. I tend to
deploy it in bulk, where it pretty much ends fights before they begin.
A good Cleric debuff, just be cautious, as it's not party friendly.

Magic Resistance
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Gives a target 2% Magic Resistance per level of the caster (up to 40%)-
but it can be dispelled. Go figure. It's a decent spell that I just
never seem to use. My Magic Resistance gets fair enough without it, and
other spells can protect me from mind affecting effects, the elements,
and low-level damaging spells.. if only there was a way to protect
against Dispel Magic.

Raise Dead [GOOD] [NEUTRAL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Revives a fallen ally with one Hit Point. If I lose a character, I
reload. I haven't used this spell since the first time I played the
game.

*Righteous Wrath of the Faithful
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The best Clerical party buff, it gives all allies a +1 bonus to THAC0,
Saves, and +1-8 Hit Points.. but for characters of the same alignment
it goes NUTS. It gives like-minded folks +2 THAC0, +2 damage, +2 saves,
and an extra attack per round. It's a huge, huge motivator for you to
make all your characters the same alignment. Haste will not stack with
it, but it will stack with Haste, oddly enough, so buff with Haste
first, then with Righteous Wrath of the Faithful. I use this for every
big fight in the game.

Shield of Lathander [GOOD] [NEUTRAL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes a non-evil target immune to damage for two rounds. Not much time,
but absolute immunity is pretty nice.. still, 5th-level spells are kind
of busy, and there's a superior version later on.

*Slay Living [NEUTRAL] [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A living creature touched must save vs. death or die. If they save, they
still take 2d8+1 points of damage. Like Finger of Death, but you need to
touch the target to cast it.. still a decent spell.

Undead Ward
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Attempts to turn all undead moving within twenty feet of the caster, as
if they were turned by the caster's Turn Undead ability. The area of the
spell's effect is static, and the spell lasts a turn. I never bother
turning unead-I don't see the point.

6th-Level Cleric Spells						{SPT010}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Entropy Shield: Best personal buff for Clerics.
  ---
Heal: Fully heals target.

Blade Barrier
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 8d8 damage to adjacent foes (save for half). The spell prevents
the caster from moving and only lasts two rounds. Yeah, it's a joke in
this game.

*Entropy Shield
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The best personal buff in the game for a Cleric, this wonderful spell
gives the caster a whopping +6 bonus to Armor Class and 50% resistance
to the elements. It also give them a +2 bonus to their Saves and
immunity to missile attacks. Freakin' awesome.

Harm
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Reduces touched foe to 1-4 Hit Points. This spell does not affect
undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.. half of the foes in the
game, and many of the meaningful ones. Save negates. I fail to see how
this is any better than Slay Living.

*Heal
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals a character fully and cures blindness, disease, and feeblemind.
It's the ultimate healing spell, and will be used very often in Heart of
Fury mode. Seriously, a single Heal can turn a fight around.

Spiritual Wrath
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A party-unfriendly attack that lets out four bolts of energy in a cross
pattern, centered on the caster. Each bolt deals 6-42 damage, save for
half. Characters of the same alignment (good, neutral, evil) are
unaffected.. another reason to be good, I suppose, but the damage is
just too paltry to worry about.

7th-Level Cleric Spells						{SPT011}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Destruction: Destroys touched target unless they save at -4.
  ---
Greater Shield of Lathander: 100% Magic Resistance and damage immunity.
  ---
Impervious Sanctity of the Mind: Prevents mind affecting effects.
  ---
Symbol of Hopelessness: Awesome debuff, huge range, save at -2.

Confusion
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like the Mage spell of the same name, it.. well, confuses all foes in a
20-foot radius, who must save at -2 to avoid the effects. Symbol of
Hopelessness is a MUCH better Clerical debuff, so let's move on, shall
we?

*Destruction [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Destroys touched target, literally blasts them into chunks if the spell
is to be believed. The target saves at -4, and if successful, they still
take 8d6 (8-48) damage. It's the best death spell in the game.

*Greater Shield of Lathander [GOOD]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Gives the target 100% Magic Resistance and makes them immune to damage,
it's a whopping protective spell, but only lasts three rounds. Best used
by one character to buy time for the rest of the characters to buff up..
like during the final battle of the main game, for instance.

Holy Word [GOOD]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Smites all creatures of evil alignment in the spell's 30-foot radius
area of effect, depending upon the target's level:

	o===============o===============================o
	|Target's Level	|	      Effect		|
	o===============o===============================o
	|     < 4	|	      Death		|
	|---------------|-------------------------------|
	|    4 - 7	|     Stunned for one turn	|
	|---------------|-------------------------------|
	|    8 - 11	|  Slowed for 1 turn with 75%   |
	|		|         spell failure		|
	|---------------|-------------------------------|
	|     > 12	| Deafness for 1 turn with 50%	|
	|		|         spell failure		|
	o===============o===============================o

As you can see, the spell's effects wane as the targets get stronger.
If your idea of a good time is to smite Goblins, then this is the
spell for you. As long as you're not in Heart of Fury mode. If you want
to smite strong foes, you'll need to look elsewhere.

*Impervious Sanctity of the Mind
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Protects the caster from Charm, Command, Confusion, Domination, Fear,
Feeblemind, Hold, Sleep, and psionics. Didn't Chaotic Commands do the
same thing? Whatever, they both last one turn a level, use whichever you
please.

Resurrection [GOOD]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Supposedly the ultimate healing spell, it revives and fully restores one
dead character. I don't let my character die, and reload if they do, so
I never feel compelled to use it.

*Symbol of Hopelessness
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
One of the best debuffs in the entire game-it's party friendly, has a
whopping 60-foot radius, and enemies who fail to save (at -2 no less)
stand in place idly for the duration of the spell-two turns (20 rounds).
You will use this constantly in Heart of Fury mode. If you intend to
win, anyways.

Symbol of Pain
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
They can't all be winners. This spell has the same huge 60-foot radius
as Symbol of Hopelessness, but no save penalty. Creatures that do fail
to save suffer a -4 THAC0 penalty, -2 Dexterity, and -2 Armor Class.
I'd take the two turns of standing around waiting to die than 2-20 turns
of combat impediments any day.

Unholy Word [EVIL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Unholy word acts exactly like Holy Word, but it only affects good
creatures. This spell is useless for the same reason that Unholy Blight
is useless-there just aren't many good foes in the game.

1st-Level Druid Spells						{SPT012}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Bless: Minor, short-lasting party buff.
  ---
Cure Light Wounds: Heals 8 Hit Points.
  ---
Curse: Minor, short-lasting debuff.
  ---
Entangle: Holds enemies in place.
  ---
Remove Fear: cures and prevents fear effects for one turn.
  ---
Sunscorch: Deals 1d6 + level damage to one foe and blinds.

*Bless
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Bless is a humble little buff that could see plenty of action. It gives
all allies in a 25-foot radius a +1 bonus to saves versus fear effects
and a +1 bonus to THAC0. The only downside? It lasts only six rounds,
so it won't be a spell I constantly use later on. It stacks with Prayer
and Recitation.

*Cure Light Wounds
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals 8 Hit Points.

*Curse
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Bless, but the opposite, it lowers enemy THAC0 and saves by one
point in a 25-foot radius. Again, at six rounds, it's duration means
it will not be an enduring debuff, but it's handy at first.

Detect Evil
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Shows you who the bad guys are. Of course, my definition of evil is a
little more flexible (it's probably that atheism thing, makes it so I
don't have any foundation for personal morality). Anybody who attacks
you, or has really good gear is 'evil' in my book, and worthy of
smiting.

*Entangle
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
In Baldur's Gate this was an extremely effective (and often abused, for
my part) Druid spell (I love Jaheira!) It only had one 'charge', and
even though foes caught could still attack, if they didn't have ranged
weapons they could be easily shot down by my archers. It was my low-
level Ogre strategy. In Icewind Dale, however, it doesn't work the same.
Instead of having a one-shot effect, it now acts like Web, continually
affecting creatures within each round. Yeah, it was broken in Baldur's
Gate, but that's why the love occured. Also, in Icewind Dale I have
much less ranged presence, due to them being overly stingy with magical
arrows. It's still a handy spell in a pinch.

Protection from Evil
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A handy little personal buff that gives the target +2 bonus to Saves and
Armor Class and protects them from charm effects, like Charm Person or
Domination. There's a superior buff down the line for the whole party,
which makes this woefully obsolete.

*Remove Fear
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Removes all fear effects in a 30-foot radius and prevents them recurring
for the duration of the spell, which is one turn (10 rounds). A handy,
low-level, always-effective defense against fear, always keep one ready.

Shillelagh
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creates a magical club that counts as a +1 weapon and deals 2-8 damage.
This spell becomes useless the second you get a magical weapon.

*Sunscorch
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A pretty handy little mini Flame Strike spell, it deals 1d6 +1 damage
per caster level to a target in sight. Against undead it deals 1d6 + 2
damage per caster level to a target. Either case, it has a chance to
blind foes for three rounds. Damage is halved by a successful save.
It's one of the best 1st-level damage dealing spells in the game.

2nd-level Druid Spells						{SPT013}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Barkskin: Decent armor substitute.
  ---
Cure Moderate Wounds: Heals 11 Hit Points. Yeah, it's a slow level.

Alicorn Lance
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Fires a silvery unicorn horn (an alicorn) at an enemy, dealing 3d6
damage (save for half). After it hits, the target suffers a -2 Armor
Class Penalty for three rounds.

*Barkskin
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Grants a target an Armor Class of six, which improves (decreases) by
one for ever four levels of the caster.. Armor Class 5 at 4th level,
Armor Class 4 at 8th, 3 at 12th, 2 at 16th, 1 at 20th, 0 at 24th, and
-1 at 28th. It's.. a pretty useful defensive spell, really, although
it doesn't stack with any actual armor you might be wearing. I tend to
be unfavorably disposed towards spells that serve as armor.. unless they
ENHANCE the Armor Class I've already got in some way. Why cast it if you
can wear it? Still, for a low-level Druid.. well, they have to memorize
something..

Beast Claw
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Gives the caster 18/72 Strength (a downgrade for most sane players)
and allows the caster to deal 2d4 + Strength damage per hit. Best of
all, it counts as a +2 weapon for determining what it can hurt.

Charm Person or Mammal
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like the 1st-level Mage spell, it makes another creatures your friend.'
It has a somewhat broader range of targets it can effect, however, but
is entirely negated by a successful saving throw.

Find Traps
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Detects traps in a very close range. This spell doesn't disarm them,
however, so it's often rather pointless.

Flame Blade
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell allows the caster to create a flaming blade, which can be
wielded as if it were a Scimitar. It deals 1d4 +4 damage base, dealing
+2 damage to creatures vulnerable to fire (including undead) or -2
damage to creatures resistant to fire. It is one of the only conjured
weapons that does not, in itself, count as a magical weapon for what
it can hit.

Goodberry
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creates a 'clump' of magical berries that heal for 5 Hit Points. These
berries last one day per caster level. One casting, one clump. This
spell is essentially a weak healing potion factory, but five Hit Points
will not a battle win. I just don't see the point-not when every other
healing spell does more.

Know Alignment
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Detect Evil, except it detects.. everything. Evil things glow red,
neutral things glow blue, and friendly things glow green.. like those
little circles under your feet!

3rd-Level Druid Spells						{SPT014}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Call Lightning: Random lightning damage outdoors.
  ---
Storm Shell: 50% resistance to fire, cold, and electricity.

*Call Lightning
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell can only be cast outdoors (over half the game is indoors!),
and calls down lightning on one foe, dealing 1d8 damage plus another
1d8 per level to that target (save for half). After picking the intial
target, the spell will randomly hit other foes within sight of the
caster for the spell's duration. It's not a great spell, but.. well,
compared to the other 3rd-level Druid spells..

Cloudburst
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This hilariously mediocre spell creates a magical rainstorm that deals
2d3 damage to all cold and fire dwelling creatures per round. Cool, so
it's party friendly, right? Not really.. all creatures in the storm have
a 50% chance per round of being struck by lightning for 2d6 damage.
Flame spells and effects like Flame Blade, Shroud of Flame and
Salamander auras are extinguished by this spell. To make it even more
laughable, the spell only lasts two rounds. Two rounds!

Hold Animal
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Hold Person, but it only works on animals-and only normal animals,
like, uh.. I suppose there are some bears in this game? You will never
need to use this spell.

Invisibility Purge
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Reveals invisible or hidden creatures in sight. This spell can be
handy on very rare occassions, but I never tend to bother with it.
There just aren't many creatures that use those spells/abilities.

Mold Touch
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Another stupid spell, it's like Flame Shroud, except with.. mold. The
caster touches a foe and they make a save, if they fail, they take
damage over the next four rounds (1st round 4d6, 2nd round 3d6, 3rd
round 2d6, 4th round 1d6, for a total of 10d6 damage). If they succeed,
they take less damage (1st round 2d6, 2nd round 1d6, 3rd round 1d6,
total 4d6). The nearest creature within ten feet after the first round
must then also save or the spell restarts with them, and so on, until
the spell runs out of victims. Ugh, seriously, why not just use a
Sunscorch? It deal guaranteed damage and you don't need to wait for it
to work.

Moonblade
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Moonlight is dangerous-just look at this weapon. It functions like a +4
weapon for determining what it can hit and deals 1d12 +4 damage..
although you get no Strength bonuses. On the plus side, it deals an
extra 1d12 versus undead and causes struck foes to suffer spell failure
in the next round. By the time you can cast it, you'll probably have
a moderately enchanted weapon to use against foes, however.

Protection from Fire
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes the Druid 80% resistant to fire. It can come in handy in a few
cases, especially since the Druid cannot cast Resist Fire/Cold for some
reason..

Spike Growth
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Another area-of-effect damage-per-round spell, it deals 1d4 piercing
and 1d4 slashing damage to all creatures in the 15-foot radius area of
effect each round, for one turn (10 rounds).

*Storm Shell
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
It's like Resist Fire/Cold, but it gives the caster 50% resistance to
electricity, too! It only lasts a turn (10 rounds), however, so use it
well.

4th-Level Druid Spells						{SPT015}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Cure Serious Wounds: Heals 17 Hit Points.
  ---
Produce Fire: Decent damage, managable radius, Troll-killer.
  ---
Star Metal Cudgel: Creates a +2 (counts as +4) Club.

Animal Summoning I
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Monster Summoning, but with animals. This spell summons up to six
animals of four Hit Dice (32 Hit Points) or less:

Black Bear
Wolf

*Cure Serious Wounds
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals 17 Hit Points.

Giant Insect
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Because one summoning spell wasn't enough-here's another. This one
enlarges nearby bugs and allows you to control them. Neat.

Bombardier Beetle
Boring Beetle

*Produce Fire
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 1-4 damage per level in a 6-foot radius, small, but at least
you're not likely to hurt party members if you aim right. It's actually
a decent direct-damage spell that will serve as a good Troll killer.

Protection From Lightning
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes a touched creature immune to lightning. You'll only likely face
lightning attacks at the beginning of the game (via spells like Static
Charge).. and the Druid has Storm Shell, which has less resistance, but
greater utility.

Smashing Wave
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creates a five-foot wide wave that smashing into enemies along a linear
path, dealing 4d10 points of crushing damage (save for half). Foes that
fail to save also have a 25% chance of being stunned for two rounds and
a 5% chance of being knocked unconscious for a round.

*Star Metal Cudgel
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A decent weapon conjuring spell that creates a +2 Club that acts as if
it were +4 for determining what it can harm. It uses the Club
proficiency, adds Strength modifiers, and in all other respects acts
like a normal weapon. It does 2d6 damage against undead, elementals,
golems and extraplanar foes-many enemies in the game. It's possible
that this will be superior to any Club, Dagger, or Scimitar you find by
the time you can cast it.

Static Charge
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Call Lightning-for indoors. It generates a static charge around a random
creature in the area of effect, and after the particularly long casting
time, that creature takes 2-16 damage plus an additional 1-8 for each
level of the caster. The game says the charge goes off once every turn
(10 rounds).. which is useless, because most fights are over by then. If
you use it at all, use it for the massive damage up front.

Thorn Spray
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Blasts a cone of thorns at foes, dealing 2d10 damage to all critters
in the area-of-effect (save for half). The game gives two areas for the
cone-in the description it's 30-foot long by 60-foot wide, while above
it in the stats it's listed as 30-foot long by 25-foot wide. Looking at
the spell on screen, the former seems more accurate.

Wall of Moonlight
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Moonlight is dangerous-and hates bad people. You create a wall of
blue-white force that deals 2d10 damage to evil creatures passing
through-or 5d10 to evil undead. A creature can only be affected once by
the wall. Again the game is very picky about what counts as evil and
what doesn't.

5th-Level Druid Spells						{SPT016}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Cure Critical Wounds: Heals 27 Hit Points.
  ---
Insect Plague: Conjures a swarm of bugs that makes casting impossible.

Animal Rage
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes one animal ferocious-and remember, humans are animals too, so this
buff works on party members. The recepient will gain a Strength score
of 19, +20 Hit Points, +20% movement speed, and +2 to all Saves. The
downside? The character goes berserk-in a party friendly sort of way-
when enemies are on screen.. and there's a 15% chance per round they
go berserk in an unfriendly way.

Animal Summoning II
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Animal Summoning, but it summons six creatures with 8 Hit Dice or
less (64 Hit Points):

Cave Bear
Dire Wolf

*Cure Critical Wounds [GOOD] [NEUTRAL]
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals 27 Hit Points.

*Insect Plague
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Now this is more like it-Insect Plague creates a 'cloud' type area of
effect spell.. except the cloud isn't made of fire, death or vapors,
it's made of insects, of course. Characters with under two Hit Dice
flee immediately, while ones with less than five must save, but most
characters will be unaffected. The swarm also deals one point of damage
every round. The real benefit of this spell, however, is that anything
caught within it will not be able to cast spells while within, making
it a decent no-spell zone (without disrupting any buffs you may
already have in place!) Just make sure you buff before hand, have Remove
Fear on, and cast away. It doesn't need to be party-friendly if you're
immune to most of the effects.

Spike Stones
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Another static area-of-effect spell. Druids just love these stupid
spells.. anyways, it makes rocks pointy. And stepping on pointy rocks is
ouchy (stepping on a d4 is a much more familiar hazard in my house..)
All characters in the 15-foot radius are of effect take 2d4 piercing
damage each round and must save vs. spell or have their movement rate
reduced by 30%.

6th-Level Druid Spells						{SPT017}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Conjure Fire Elemental: Conjures a decently strong elemental.
  ---
Entropy Shield: Best personal buff for Druids.
  ---
Heal: Fully heals target.

Animal Summoning III
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons up to four animals with 16 Hit Dice (128 Hit Points) or less:

Dire Wolf
Polar Bear
Winter Wolf

*Conjure Fire Elemental
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Superior to the Mage version, this spell has a 65% chance to summon a
12 Hit Dice elemental, a 20% chance of summoning a 16 Hit Dice
elemental, a 10% chance of summoning and 20 Hit Dice elemental, and a
5% chance to summon a 24 Hit Dice elemental. All in all, it's a decent
summoning spell.

*Entropy Shield
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The best personal buff in the game for a Druid, this wonderful spell
gives the caster a whopping +6 bonus to Armor Class and 50% resistance
to the elements. It also give them a +2 bonus to their Saves and
immunity to missile attacks. Freakin' awesome.

Fire Seeds
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell just reeks of ass. It conjures up four grenade-like missiles,
which then can be equipped into quick-item slots and thrown at foes.
Each one deals a mighty 2-16 damage to everything within a five-foot
radius-creatures struck get no save, but those taking splash damage can
save for half. Seriously, Sunscorch, a 1st-level spell, is better than
this for a high-level Druid! I just don't get these developers some
times.. I'd still call it assy if it was a 3rd-level spell, but it's
rubbing elbows with Heal and Entropy Shield! Mind-boggling..

*Heal
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals a character fully and cures blindness, disease, and feeblemind.
It's the ultimate healing spell, and will be used very often in Heart of
Fury mode. Seriously, a single Heal can turn a fight around.

Sol's Searing Orb
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A direct-damage fire spell that deals 6d12 (6-72) damage to a target and
blinds them for 1d6 rounds. If the target saves, they take half damage
and are not blinded. Does double damage to undead, which would be the
only critters worth using it on.

Whirlwind
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Another stupid, unpredictable Druid spell-this class is just awful in
most 2nd-Edition games.. Anyways, you can direct this spell in a line
upon casting, after which it goes haywire, randomly moving on its own.
Anything hit by it-friend or foe-takes 2d8 crushing damage and 2d8
slashing damage, and if they fail their save are stunned for two rounds.
This spell instantly kills any creatures with two Hit Dice (16 Hit
Points) or less.. but so do most good farts. It'll hit up to eight
targets before dissipating.

7th-Level Druid Spells						{SPT018}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Creeping Doom: Summons vicious swarms of insects to attack.
  ---
Impervious Sanctity of the Mind: Prevents mind affecting effects.

Conjure Earth Elemental
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Superior to the Mage version, this spell has a 65% chance to summon a
12 Hit Dice elemental, a 20% chance of summoning a 16 Hit Dice
elemental, a 10% chance of summoning and 20 Hit Dice elemental, and a
5% chance to summon a 24 Hit Dice elemental. All in all, it's a decent
summoning spell. Unforunately, it's the same level as the best
summoning spell in the game, so I can't see why anybody would bother
memorizing this when they can memorize..

*Creeping Doom
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
..Creeping Doom, the best summoning spell in the game. It does have some
downsides-each one has individually poor Armor Class and no elemental
resistances, and their THAC0 is pretty bad, but each swarm has 150 Hit
Points and deals 4d10 damage per hit. You'll also summon several of them
each cast. Summon them, buff them up, and send them to go massacre
things.

Earthquake
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Moves the party to California, over the San Andreas fault.. just for a
few minutes, but long enough. Nah, seriously, it causes an earthquake
that affects the whole screen.. but it's party friendly! It only deals
4d10+2 damage, but forces targets to save vs. death or be knocked prone
for three rounds. Here's the kicker though-large creatuers and anything
with ten Hit Dice or more are unaffected. That's pretty much everything
in Heart of Fury mode. What assy-ass-ass.

Fire Storm
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The Druid's delayed version of Fireball. It deals 2-16 +1 damage per
level damage (32-46 max) to everything within a 25-foot radius area.
Save for half damage.

*Impervious Sanctity of the Mind
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Protects the caster from Charm, Command, Confusion, Domination, Fear,
Feeblemind, Hold, Sleep, and psionics. Druids don't get Chaotic Commands
like Clerics do, so this is a much-needed defense.

Mist of Eldath
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Heals everything in a 10-foot radius for 25 Hit Points and cures them
of diseases and poisons. Interesting.. but plenty of lesser spells do
the job just as well or better.

Stalker
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons two Shambling Mounds-relatively hardy monsters thanks to their
resistances, although they're not terribly well-protected by Hit Points.
It's a decent summon, but I'd rather go with Creeping Doom.

Sunray
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creates a dazzling light in a 15-foot radius that lasts four rounds.
Creatures in the area of effect must save vs. spells or be blinded for
1-3 rounds. Undead or fungi take 8-48 damage (save for half).

1st-Level Mage Spells						{SPT019}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Burning Hands: Kills Trolls dead-like.
  ---
Chromatic Orb: Fair damage and debilitations.
  ---
Friends: Raises Charisma for questiness.
  ---
Identify: Identifies magical stuff.
  ---
Magic Missile: Dependable, level-scaling damage.
  ---
Shield: Blocks Magic Missiles.

Armor
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell lowers your Armor Class to six (as if you were wearing Scale
Mail), and lasts a whopping nine hours. Unfortunately, Mage-friendly
armor abounds in this game, so this spell becomes entirely obsolete
fairly quickly.

*Burning Hands
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell, if properly deployed, shoots a jet of flames in a short
arc in front of the caster, potentially harming several foes. The only
great use for this is dispatching Trolls.

Charm Person
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Turns one 'bidpedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or
smaller' into an ally. We'll be fighting many creatures that do not
meet this description, and many undead. By the time you actually find
human foes worth using this on, you'll have access to better spells.

Chill Touch
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals a paltry 1d4 damage and bestows a -1 THAC0 modifier for an hour.
Against undead, it does neither of the above effects, but causes them to
panic for 1d4 +1 turns per level of the caster. Why is beyond me. This
is, however, a touch spell.. ideally you don't want to be in melee
casting spells. I don't care to hinder or frighten one foe, in melee,
dependant upon a melee attack, with no save penalty.

*Chromatic Orb
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
One of the more interesting 1st-level Mage spells, Chromatic Orb changes
the damage type and side effect by level, as follows:

		o=======o=======o=======================o
		| Level	|Damage | 	 Effect		|
		o=======o=======o=======================o
		|  1st	|  1-4	|   Blindness/1 round	|
		|-------|-------|-----------------------|
		|  2nd	|  1-6	|         Pain		|
		|-------|-------|-----------------------|
		|  3rd	|  1-8	|     Burns Victim	|
		|-------|-------|-----------------------|
		|  4th	| 1-10	|   Blindness/4 turns	|
		|-------|-------|-----------------------|
		|5th-6th| 1-12	|    Stuns/3 rounds	|
		|-------|-------|-----------------------|
		|7th-9th| 2-16	|  Paralysis/13 rounds	|
		o=======o=======o=======================o

As you can see, some of the effects are quite good, and although there's
no save penalty, the chance to debilitate a foe might make this spell
worth more than the brute damage of Magic Missile.

Color Spray
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A cone spell that affects one-to-six creatures, it gets stronger the
more powerful the caster is in relation to the targets, although
anything with 5+ Hit Dice are entitled to save against it. In essence,
you can use this spell to pick on weaker creatures, which have no hope
of saving. Its effects vary-from knocking creatures weaker than the
caster unconscious, to blinding stronger foes, or stunning foes of the
same strength. I don't even bother with this, since most of the early
foes are undead, the range of the spell puts the caster in danger, and
it has no save penalty.

*Friends
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell raises the caster's Charisma by 5. All my characters have a
base Charisma of 10, so this won't effect store prices.. but there are
some dialogue options it will allow me to succeed at. You won't need it
prepared all the time, but it has its uses..

Grease
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
It's like a party-unfriendly Slow spell without the combat penalties and
a laughable range. I never use this spell.

*Identify
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Just because a spell is 1st-level, doesn't mean it's useless-and
Identify just might be the most useful 1st-level spell in the game. Find
a piece of magical gear that you want to know more about? Bam. Identify
it. It saves money, prevents you from strapping on a cursed loincloth
of manhood biting, and just generally makes life better. It's one of
those good things in life.

Infravision
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Highlights your enemies with a healthy orange glow. You'll never need
it. Foes have big red rings under their feet, and all Elves and Dwarves
have it by default.

Larloch's Minor Drain
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A humble little spell that steals 1d4 Hit Points from the enemy and
gives them to the caster. Once meaningful damage in combat starts to be
measured in two digits, however, this spell is obsolete.

*Magic Missile
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The humble, but ever-useful Magic Missile is one of the most iconic
spells out there. It's a mediocre direct damage dealer that allows you
to cast it at a range (hence, safely), it's unerring (no attack rolls
needed), there's no save for damage, and it deals 1d4+1 points of damage
for every two extra levels of experience you get another missile-hence,
another 1d4+1 damage (two at 3rd-level, three at 5th-level, four at
7th-level, and finally five at 9th-level. That's 10-25 damage in a
pinch-not terrible, but not great, either.

Protection from Evil
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A simple buff that forces evil foes to attack at -2 THAC0 against the
protected character and gives them a +2 Save bonus against.. anything
that causes saving throws originating from an evil source. There is a
much, much better area-of-effect version of this spell that the Cleric
can cast.

*Shield
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Armor, it boosts the Armor Class of the caster-setting it to four
against normal attacks, and two against missiles. The biggest draw about
it, however, is that it blocks all Magic Missile spells, which can be
quite harrowing in Heart of Fury mode.. making it the ONLY 1st-level
spell you'll cast in Heart of Fury for combat purposes.. unless you
decide to be all special and cast Globe of Invulnerability or something.

Shocking Grasp
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell is another touch damage-dealer.. save it deals useless
electrical damage instead of useful fire damage. It's somewhat useful
against a very, very rare creature-the Shambler-but you won't encounter
them until very late in the game.

Sleep
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The low-level party spell of choice, this spell puts creatures with
less than 4+3 Hit Dice to sleep (4d8+3 Hit Points). It's gold against
the initial Orcs, Goblins, and Ogres you face, but useless against the
undead that follow, and obsolete thereafter.

Shoots out a jet of fire, dealing 3-18 points of damage to the target,
and 2-16 to anybody in the path of the flames otherwise. It's a decent
Troll-killer, if you line it up right.

Blindness
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A deceptively potent little spell, Blindness.. well, blinds its target
(save negates), and for a whopping eight hours. While blinded, creatures
suffer a -4 penalty to Armor Class and THAC0. It's like the Slow spell
from next level, except it doesn't slow, effects only one foe, and has
no save penalty. Can you wait a level?

*Blur
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A useful Mage buff, it effectively lowers your Armor Class by three and
gives you a +1 bonus to your Saves. The Shimmering Sash permanently
duplicates this effect while worn, but until you have six of them, this
spell is worth keeping in your spellbooks.

Cat's Grace
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell boosts a target's Dexterity by a number of points depending
upon your class (1d8 for Thief, 1d6 for a Fighter or a Mage, and 1d4 for
a Cleric). This spell sucks, however, since it won't raise your
Dexterity over 20, and since all your characters started with 18
Dexterity, you won't be getting much of a benefit from this spell..
right?

Decastave
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons a weak magical staff with minor life-leeching on the first hit.
Single-class Mages should avoid combat, dual-or-multi-class Mages will
have access to far superior weaponry.

Detect Evil
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Detects Evil creatures and characters. Don't worry about it, this game
is not subtle-evil people typically don't have complex schemes. You'll
know they're bad when they attack you.

Note: The Mage scrolls of Detect Evil in the game incorrectly list the
spell as a 1st-level spell, although it's really a 2nd-level spell.
Don't believe me? Scribe it and see which page it ends up on. At first
I thought the developers may have accidently just copied the Cleric
version of the spell for the Mage, but this is not the case-the two
have different descriptive texts. This is apparently just a typo.

Detect Invisibility
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Very rarely does this spell come in handy-it'll remove the invisibility
from sneaking or invisible characters.

Ghoul Touch
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A melee Mage spell that attempts to paralyze creatures for six rounds..
since it has no save penalty, why not just use Chromatic Orb, instead?
No save penalty, but it deals damage and is a ranged effect.

Horror
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes enemies in the area of effect run about all scared-like. No save
penalty, and there aren't a whole lot of living foes to use this on
before you'll gain access to better debuffs.

*Invisibility
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes you Invisible, good for sneaking, so you can spot enemies, or run
to random loot objects and item fish, or so you can disarm traps near
foes without alerting them. This spell is frequently useful throughout
the game.

*Knock
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Don't have a Thief with good Open Locks? Don't worry, you will..
eventually. In the meantime, this 3rd level Mage spell automagically
unlocks locked objects. Obsolete once you get a Thief to do it for you.

Luck
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A single-target buff that only lasts three rounds.. I really don't see
the point. It bestows a +1 bonus to Saves, Attack Rolls, thieving
skills, and the like. Doesn't Prayer do the same thing, for the whole
party, for one round per level, and inflict the opposite on foes?
Rhetorical question.. it does.

*Melf's Acid Arrow
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A reliable damage-dealer, you shoot out a bolt of acid that deals 2-8
points of acid damage. For every three levels of the caster the spell
will linger another round (presumably up to a max of ten rounds at level
30). That's 20-80 damage.. granted over a long time.. but it's an
excellent Troll killer, since if the Troll isn't killed by the damage
outright, it'll likely get killed by it on a subsequent round.

*Mirror Image
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Another fantastic Mage buff, this spell creates several duplicate
mirages of the Mage, confusing foes in combat into striking the wrong
target. On its own, it'll buy the Mage some time (with any luck), with
an Armor Class of -20 something and Stoneskin, it'll make you all but
immortal.

Protection from Petrification
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Protects you from petrification gazes. Guess what? I haven't encountered
a single Basilisk, Cocatrice, or Medusa in the entire game. The only
thing that petrifies you are.. perhaps friendly fire from an enchanted
weapon (how could you prepare for that?) and a cursed ring. You'll never
need this spell.

Resist Fear
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Removes fear effects in a 30-foot radius and prevents them from occuring
again for an hour. Clerics get Remove Fear at level one, which doesn't
use up a precious 2nd-level spell slot.

Snilloc's Snowball Swarm
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creates a burst of snowballs that deal 1-3 cold damage per level, up to
a maximum of 8-24 damage at 8th-level. Against fiery foes it deals 1-6
damage per level.. presumably to a maximum of 8-36 at 8th-level. Note
that the name of the game is ICEwind Dale. Many foes in this game are
going to be.. somewhat less than 'who gives a crap' towards cold damage,
and brute force is folly in Heart of Fury mode.

Stinking Cloud
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A decent area-of-effect debuff, it'll force creatures inside to save or
fall unconscious for a round.. where they can save again, or stay
unciousious, and so on. It doesn't affect undead, however, so there's
the possibility of using a Stinking Cloud/Animate dead combo.. except
that Animate Dead isn't up to snuff in this game, and many of the
creatures you will be fighting are undead.

Strength
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Increases the target's Strength up to 18/00. This is a marginal bonus
for my party, and not worth the effort.

*Web
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Stinking Cloud, it disables all foes in its radius, allowing them a
save each round to avoid the effects of the Web. The plus side, however,
is that it effects undead. Also, Rings of Free Action are easily the
most plentiful magical rings in the game-you can get two of them right
near the beginning of the game, in fact! This allows you to use what I
call the multi-Web combo. Cast several Webs in one place (ideally a
bottle-neck) and laugh as foes get stuck. And by laugh, I mean attack
them with your characters wearing Rings of Free Action, who will be
unaffected by the Web. It's hardly even fair, and it's my low-level
tactic of choice.

3rd-Level Mage Spells						{SPT021}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Dispel Magic: Removes buffs/debuffs from foes/friends, ideally.
  ---
Flame Arrow: High damage output, Troll-killer.
  ---
Haste: Turns your party into death incarnate.
  ---
Slow: Great debuff that neuters melee foes.

Dire Charm
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Charm Person, but more Dire! Really, besides lasting longer I don't
think this spell even does anything different.

*Dispel Magic
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Sometimes enemies cast bad spells that need to go-like buffs on their
allies, or debuffs on you. Chaos can win a fight for you, or end a fight
against you.. unless you dispel it. Fortunately, you won't be facing
many intelligent spell-casters, so the need to use this is much less
frequent than in the Baldur's Gate games. I still keep one handy at all
times on every spell-casting character.

Fireball
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The iconic Fireball is the noob's spell of choice! It deals 1-6 damage
per level up to a maximum of 10-60 damage in a 20-foot radius, and
allows a save for half damage. This spell is at best mediocre, for
several reasons. First, many foes will just survive it. Instead of
using this spell-why not a debuff like Slow, or Web, or Silence 15'
Radius (to just name spells around the same level), which will severely
hamper an enemy? Second, it's not party-friendly, so unlike Slow and
Chaos, to name the best debuffs, you shouldn't use it while engaged.
Third in Heart of Fury foes have too many Hit Points to even bother with
10-60 damage. Finally.. that damage tends to get shaved down a lot by
saves and rolls. Don't drool over the 60 damage, the dice average is
35, and on a succesful save, that's a measly 17 damage. There are far,
far better 3rd-level spells to memorize. And no, it's not a signifantly
superior Troll-killer than Melf's Acid Arrow, since it's not party
friendly.

*Flame Arrow
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell conjures up a fiery arrow-one for every five experience
levels (up to six at level thirty). Each does 1-6 points of Piercing
Damage unfailingly, and another 4-24 fire damage (save vs. Spells for
half). So against a single target, the damage potential is 30-180, with
a guaranteed 3-18 damage per arrow (barring resistances). If you need
to use a direct-damage dealer, use this instead of Fireball. It is,
of course, an excellent Troll-killer, is party friendly, and has more
damage potential and higher guaranteed damage return.. at least, once
you're higher level. This spell is extraordinarily brutal when the
computers casts it in Heart of Fury mode.. as in one-hit kill kind of
brutal.

Ghost Armor
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Gives a base Armor Class of three (like Plate Mail), but only lasts
one round per level. By the time you get this, you'll soon be getting
armor of the more permanent variety that is just as good.

*Haste
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Honestly, it's the ultimate Mage buff, the buff to end all buffs. Most
fights in normal difficulty can be resolved with a simple Haste spell,
and many fights in Heart of Fury mode cannot be resolved without it.
Haste doubles your attack speed and movement speed for 3 rounds + 1
round/level. After the spell is over, however, fatigue will set in,
making multiple uses of Haste without resting dangerous. Of course, if
you cast Dispel Magic before the spell wears off.. no fatigue for you!
It's even more potent when paired with other buffs-particularly the
awesome Clerical spell Righteous Wrath of the Faithful. The two are not
friends, however, since the latter increases the number of attacks you
get too. If you cast Righteous Wrath of the Faithful first, Haste will
have no effect. If you cast Haste first.. well, the goodness multiplies,
and the enemies die horribly. It's a good thing.

Hold Person
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Paralyzes 1-4 humans, demihumans, or humanoids in a very close area of
effect. It's a good spell.. save for the fact that it has no save
penalty, crappy radius, and almost every foe in the game is not affected
by it. Also, Clerics get the same spell as a 2nd-level spell.. so just
use theirs, instead.

Icelance
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 5-30 damage to one creature and forces them to save vs. spells
or be stunned for 1-4 rounds. Am I missing something, or is this not
significantly better than Chromatic Orb? It's not, really, and not worth
a 3rd-level spell slot. Also, I need to hammer this home; ice = bad.
Icy creatures probably don't mind the cold too much, and what are we
likely to find in ICEwind Dale? Glaciers, tundra, snow, ice, cold, and
things that like to live there?

Lance of Disruption
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A line effect that deals 5d4 +2 damage/level (up to a maximum of 30)
against all critters in its path, allowing a save vs. spells for half
damage. I hate to say it, but even Fireball is better.

Lightning Bolt
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Fireball.. but in a line, and it bounces off crap and can
potentially hit a foe several times. Does the same 1-6 damage per level
as Fireball, and allows the same save for half, but is inherently more
interesting. Although, fire damage is better, and honestly, I just have
no luck (skill?) with this spell. I'm more of a danger to myself than
others.

Monster Summoning I
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons 2-6 1st level monsters that serve your every command. Where do
they come from? Where do they go? Nobody knows! They're really only good
for fodder, and this is true for most monster summoning spells. The
spell will summon a number of the same type of creatures (randomly
determined each time you cast the spell), it will not mix and match.
The creatures summoned are as follows:

Fire Beetle
Goblin (archer)
Goblin (melee)

Non-Detection
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell is utterly pointless-I have not encountered a single foe
who will use any of the spells or effects this spell protects against.
Plus, you can just find a cloak that permantly bestows the effects of
this spell, if it really mattered.

Protection from Normal Missiles
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A spell the enemy will use to great effect that you, sadly, cannot
usually find much use for. Why? Most foes will either have magical
arrows (surprisingly early in the game, in fact), and there just aren't
too many archers in the game once you get this spell. In fact, after
the Severed Hand, there are very, very few indeed, and they tend not to
be very threatening. You, however, will always be trying to preserve
what few magical arrows you have.

Skull Trap
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Sets an exploding skull trap that deals 1-6 damage per level of the
caster to all foes in a 10-foot radius. You could use it to set a trap,
but I prefer to just use bottlenecks and debuffs, personally. You tend
to affect more foes, more reliably, and more severely that way.

*Slow
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Can I heap enough praise upon this almighty debuff? Probably, and since
it seems possible, I'll actually bother. It affects all foes in a
generous 20-foot radius, imposes a -4 penalty on their save against the
effects, and if it works, it'll slow their attack and movement values to
half their normal rates. It also inflicts a +4 penalty to their Armor
Class and a -4 penalty to their THAC0. Simply put, it's the anti-Haste;
as good of a debuff as Haste is a buff. Any melee-foes affected by this
spell are dead. Harmless, neutered, and capable of only patomiming
desperately in slow motion before you indulge the reaper and finish
them off. It's an excellent spell that you should abuse from the moment
you get it until the moment you finish the game in Heart of Fury mode.

Vampiric Touch
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Larloch's Minor Drain, but a touch attack. It attempts to steal
1-6 Hit Points per two levels (up to 6-36 at 12th-level) and heal you
the corresponding amount. Mages. Stay. Out. Of. Combat. Plus, with
spells like Dispel Magic, Haste, and Slow.. why would you ever bother
with this?

4th-Level Mage Spells						{SPT022}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Emotion: Courage: A long-lasting, potent buff.
  ---
Emotion: Hope: A long-lasting, somewhat more potent buff.
  ---
Greater Malison: Makes all subsequent debuffs more potent.
  ---
Improved Invisibility: Good defensive buff, protects against spells.
  ---
Stoneskin: The ultimate physical buff.

Confusion
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Although it's aped by its 5th-level counter-part, Chaos, Confusion is
a decent debuff when you get it. All foes within a 30-foot radius area
must save at a -2 or either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about
aimlessly for the duration of the spell. One of these spells can all but
end all resistance in a single casting. It's only limitation? As an
Enchantment/Charm, it will not work on undead, automata, or other
un-thinking creatures.

Dimension Door
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Teleports the caster to any place within their sight range. Really?
Can't you just walk? I'm sure there's supposed to be some strategic
merit to this spell (there sure as hell is in pen-and-paper Dungeons and
Dragons) but in this game, it's just a waste of a 4th-level spell slot.

*Emotion: Courage
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The lesser of the two Emotion buffs, it's still a very good buff to
cast. It gives every ally in a 10-foot radius +1 THAC0, +3 damage,
+5 Hit Points, and nullifies any fear effects that might be on them.
It also lasts a hefty five turns (50 rounds), which makes it one of my
choice long-term buffs that I tend to keep constantly applied to my
party.

Emotion: Fear
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
An Emotion debuff, it's not nearly as good as its brother buffs. It
causes fear within foes in a 10-foot radius, who will stand around
addled for the (5 round) duration of the spell. This spell is clearly
inferior to Confusion in every way, and I have to wonder if it's even
any better than the 2nd-level Mage spell, Horror.

*Emotion: Hope
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The superior Emotion spell, it gives all allies in a 10-foot radius
+2 THAC0, +2 Saves, and +2 damage for five turns (50 rounds). It stacks
with Emotion: Courage.. so despite this one being superior, I see no
reason why we shouldn't keep both on our party as much as possible.

Emotion: Hopelessness
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell works just like Emotion: Fear, save it lasts twice as long,
and isn't party friendly. Absolutely inferior to Confusion.

*Greater Malison
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Imposes a -2 penalty to the saves of all foes within a 30-foot radius.
This spell is harmless enough on its own, but when it preceeds a vicious
spell-assault, it makes every other spell that much more likely to
succeed. With a party full of spell-casters, I can always find a
character to throw this out.. on the other hand, with a party full of
spell-casters, one has to wonder if they'd all just be better off trying
to cast a debilitative spell.

Ice Storm
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3-30 damage is nothing to get excited about, and cold damage is bad.

*Improved Invisibility
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Invisibility, but improved! How is it improved? When you take an
action, you only become quasi-visibile. Foes can attack you (but they
cannot target you with spells), but you retain some great defensive
bonuses, namely a +4 bonus to Armor Class and a +4 bonus to Saves. In
Icewind Dale, most foes just don't have an answer to the Invisibility,
and it especially confounds spell-casters. Then again, most foes are
very unsophisticated spell-casters, and will just target other
characters with cloud-effect spells, area of effect offensive spells
like Cone of Cold, or area debuffs. It's always possible for a critter
to toss out a Dispel Magic or Invisibility Purge, too, although these
spells seem to be rarely prepared. A party full of characters with
Improved Invisibility can therefore, become almost immune to magic.

Minor Globe of Invulnerability
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This is a mediocre spell until Heart of Fury, where you'll come to
respect the damage output of offensive spells. In the main game, you
never really need to fear 1st-3rd level enemy spells (the most common
spell you'll have thrown at you is Hold Person). In Heart of Fury,
however, a single Magic Missile or Flame Arrow can all but kill a
character. This spell prevents that.. or at least forces them to dig
higher level spells out of their spell-books.

Monster Summoning II
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons 1-6 2nd-level creatures.

Bombardier Beetle
Goblin Elite (archer)
Goblin Elite (melee)
Lizard Man

Mordenkainen's Force Missiles
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
One of many attempts throughout gaming to recreate an uber version of
Magic Missile. Everybody loves Magic Missile, and frankly, it's an
over-powered spell for its level, but not so over-powered that it breaks
the game. If you were to take that spell and actually scale it by level,
it would break the game before too long. So comprimises are made, and
this is the result. You create a variable number of missiles-one at
7th-level, up to seven at 25th-level. Each missile unerringly deals
2d4 points of damage to one target, then bursts in a 5-foot radius,
dealing one point of damage per level of the caster. So assuming the
damage per level scales up until level twenty-five at least, the
potential damage output of this spell is 2-8 +25 damage per missile,
or 14-56 +175 damage. Of course, the enemy can make a save (at no
penalty) to outright negate all the bonus damage. I'd rather stick with
a high-level Flame Arrow, myself. At least half the fire damage is
guaranteed.

Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Traps a friend or foe in a sphere that makes them immune to damage, but
also incapable of affecting the outside world. It's best used as a
debuff to knock a foe out of a fight temporarily. There's no save
penalty, however, so I'd rather just cast Chaos, which can potentially
take a whole host of creatures out of the fight.. and still allow me to
damage them.

Remove Curse
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Curses do happen-usually through putting on cursed gear, or being
subjected to spells. The latter will go away on its own, the former
will not. Honestly, however, I never use this spell. Just Identify gear
beforehand and you'll be fine.

Shadow Monsters
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons a bunch of shadow critters of any level between one and the
level of the caster until the level of the caster has been reached.
In other words, it summons a menagerie of beasts relative to the
caster's level. These critters have 20% of the normal Hit Points of
the creature, but are otherwise full strength. Despite how random this
seems, there are only eight monsters that can be summoned:

Goblin (1st-level)
Goblin (2nd-level)
Goblin (3rd-level)
Lizard Man (3rd-level)
Lizard Man (4th-level)
Lizard Man (5th-level)
Troll (6th-level)
Troll (7th-level)
Troll (8th-level)

Clearly, you will never see a 10th-level monster like the spell's
description claims. Honestly, I don't see how this summoning spell is
really much superior to any of the others.

Shout
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deafens creatures in a cone area-of-effect for 2d6 rounds and deals 4d6
damage. The deafness can be negated by a saving throw, and the damage
cut in half. If you smell something weak, it's this spell.

Spirit Armor
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The last of the armor spells, this one grants the caster incoporeal
armor with an Armor Class of one that gives him a +3 bonus to save vs.
magical attacks and deals 2d4 damage to the caster at the end of the
spell, which lasts three turns (30 rounds). It's a fair spell, but
again, we'll find armor to surpass it.

*Stoneskin
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The best defensive spells against physical attacks in the game-it
creates numerous barriers that harmlessly deflect any and all physical
attacks, regardless of damage or enchantment. The caster gains a number
of these barrier equal to 1d4 +1 per/2 levels.. up to a maximum of
19 'skins' at level 30. Nineteen attacks utterly negated and ignored.
Best of all, it casts very quickly, hinders the caster in no way, and
lasts.. pretty much until the next time you rest. The game even tells
you how bad-ass this spell is 'Arguably one of the best defensive spells
ever...' Arguably? There is no argument! Again, this spell was designed
for Mages-put it on a Fighter/Mage multi-or-dual-class with a naturally
high Armor Class, and other spell buffs, and you're almost invincible.
It's a must-have spell.

Vitrolic Sphere
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
An acid sphere that deals 1d4 damage per level of the caster to a single
target (up to a maximum of 12d4). Targets within five feet also take
1d4 splash damage per five levels of the caster. The main target will
continue to take damage every round-2d4 less damage per round than the
previous round. For example, if the initial damage as 12d4, they'd take
10d4 the next round, 8d4 the round thereafter, and so on. Only the
initial damage is guaranteed, the lingering damage and the splash damage
can both be negated by saving throws. Number crunching time! Only 12-48
damage is guaranteed with a possible one-foe maximum of 42-168. It's
twice as potent as Melf's Acid Arrow (and over a shorter time), but
it's also a very competitive 4th-level spell. I just can't see ever
using it when I could be casting one of the Emotions, Stoneskin, or
Improved Invisibility.

5th-Level Mage Spells						{SPT023}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Chaos: Ultimate Mage debuff, Confusion on 'roids.
  ---
Contact Other Plane: Ask a spirit questions.
  ---
Lower Resistance: Drops target's Magic Resistance

*Chaos
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The best Mage debuff in the game, and easily the best 5th-level spell,
it works like Confusion, but forces foes to save a -4. Use it against
any and all living foes to win fights outright.

Cloudkill
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell instantly slays any foes with less than 4+1 Hit Dice
(33 Hit Points) with no save, and any creature above that mark, but with
few than 6 Hit Dice (48 Hit Points) must save or die. Everybody else
must save or take 1-10 damage per round that they remain in the cloud.
It's a poor spell for us, since it's party unfriendly, but several foes
will use this spell-and for our multi-class party, we might even see
this spell before we're 7th level, and hence, before we're immune to the
death effect. Undead are immune, another fact you can expect the
computer to take advantage of.

Cone of Cold
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Ice = bad. Anyways, this spell deals 2-5 damage per caster level
(presumably to a max of 60-150 damage at level 30) in a rather large
cone area of effect. When the computer deploys this in Heart of Fury
mode, it can wipe out an entire party. For us, however, it's just
another mediocre damage dealer.

Conjure Earth Elemental
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Conjures a fairly strong Earth Elemental to fight for you. I'd consider
this an improvement over summoning weaker monsters via Monster Summoning
spells.

Conjure Fire Elemental
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Conjures a fairly strong Fire Elemental to fight for you. I'd consider
this an improvement over summoning weaker monsters via Monster Summoning
spells.

Conjure Water Elemental
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Conjures a fairly strong Water Elemental to fight for you. I'd consider
this an improvement over summoning weaker monsters via Monster Summoning
spells.

*Contact Other Plane
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A.. fairly interesting spell, actually. Use it to summon a 'Planar
Spirit' who will answer one question for you. The questions you can ask
vary by chapter (and include Heart of Winter, but not Trials of the
Luremaster). Typically you can ask about plot points (where will I find
such and such bad guy), treasure, or even more vague questions. The
Planar Spirit answers truthfully, if obscurely, so it tends not to be
much help, although it is interesting to summon at the start of every
chapter to see what's up. It is, on at least one occassion, genuinely
useful, as you can ask the name of a certain demon, which allows you
to defeat it. Note that you must know about a subject to ask a question
about it. If you do not know who Jhonen is, and what his troubles are,
you cannot ask about them. Detailed information about this spell can be
found in [COP001]-yeah, that's right, this spell gets its own section.

Demi-shadow Monsters
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Shadow Monsters, but the summoned critters haver 40% of their
health. The monsters shown below may be summoned in addition to the ones
from Shadow Monsters:

Goblin Elite (1st-level)
Goblin Elite (2nd-level)
Goblin Elite (3rd-level)
Tough Lizard Man (5th-level)
Tough Lizard Man (6th-level)
Tough Lizard Man (7th-level)
Verbeeg (6th-level)
Verbeeg (7th-level)
Verbeeg (8th-level)

Domination
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Charm, but it affects more creatures, and.. well, DOMINATE sounds
cooler than 'charm'. It also imposes a -2 save, so it's not entirely
useless.. alas, I'd always rather cast Chaos.

Feeblemind
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A rather damning spell that turns the target into a conservative-a
gibbering idiot. It effectively takes a character out of any fight,
since they cannot be controlled. Of course, Domination takes them out
of the fight.. and lets YOU control them. Isn't that better? And Chaos
takes many foes out of a fight at a -4 save. Is that better still?

Hold Monster
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Hold Person, but without that stupid 'person' requirement. It
holds pretty much any living critter. It's still bafflingly under-
powered compared to mighty Chaos.

*Lower Resistance
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Some foes in this game have a rather absurdly high Magic Resistance
(one foe has so much, he's really outright immune to magic). My ideal
solution is to simply buff up and smite them with weapons of death-
making, but for the more magically inclined (and inefficient) among us,
this option exists. It'll strip 30% +1% per level of the caster of the
target's Magic Resistance-up to 60% for a max-level Mage. This is
pretty damn potent, and two of them eradicates the Magic Resistance of
anything, Drow, Demon, or Dragon. You know.. I never understood this
about spells.. why would a creature who is immune to magic (however
that happens in the first place-MAGIC SHIELD!) NOT be immune to magic
which makes them less immune to magic? Beats me..

Monster Summoning III
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
You know the drill.. this spell summons 1-4 3rd-level critters:

Boring Beetle
Ghoul
Huge Spider
Neo Orog
Tough Lizard Man

Shroud of Flame
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Causes a creature to burst into flame, taking 2d6 damage per round
(the duration is half the caster's level). Any creature within 10 feet
also takes 1d4 damage from the flames per round. Anybody hit by the
victim of the spell risk 'contracting' the shroud themselves. The spell
dissipates if the target and caster are no longer in the same area..
This spell, is therefore obviously very risky to employ, as you have
a good chance of taking fire damage, or even contracting the spell
yourself.. and the whole spell can be negated by a single save vs.
spells.

Summon Shadow
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell is, like Animate Dead, a lying, rat-bastard phony-fraud. It
says you summon one Shadow per three levels of the caster. What it
doesn't say is that the maximum you'll get per casting is three Shadows,
and that the party has a cap of six summons at a time. If you were
expecting a small army of Shadows, you will be disappointed.

Sunfire
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Fireball-but centered on the caster. It deals a maximum of 15d6
damage (15-90 damaeg), with a save for half damage. The biggest problem
with this spell is that the caster has to be the focal point-ideally
charging on ahead away from the rest of the party to make the most of
this spell. Again, I'd rather just use Chaos.

6th-Level Mage Spells						{SPT024}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Disintegrate: Obliterates one foe.
  ---
Flesh to Stone: Petrifies one foe.
  ---
Globe of Invulnerability: Makes you immune to 1st-4th level spells.
  ---
Tenser's Transformation: Ultimate buff that makes you godly.

Antimagic Shell
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Makes the caster immune to magic! Yay! But it also means they are
unaffected by buffs. Not yay. My party is nothing without magic, and
this spell really hinders more than it helps.

Chain Lightning
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Strikes a target with a 1-6 damage per level bolt of lightning (maximum
of 12-72 damage), then jumps off to surrounding creatures. Each jump
deals 1d6 less damage than the originals. All creatures can save for
half damage. Unpredictable and not party-friendly = no thanks.

Darts of Bone
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creates nine magical darts that can be thrown. Mages should NOT rely on
their THAC0 to determine spell efficacy, and on top of that, the darts
aren't really all that strong-they do 1d4 damage and if hit, the target
must save vs. death or take another 2d6 damage and lose three Strength
for.. five rounds. Again, I'd rather take the quicker, guaranteed damage
of Flame Arrow.

Death Fog
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
When a critter enters, it is slowed by 50% and takes scaling damage
each round: 1st round-4 damage, 2nd round-8 damage, 3rd+ rounds-16
damage. They also must save vs. death of lose two Strength and two
Dexterity for that round. Again, wasn't Chaos a more effective debuff
than this?

Death Spell
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell attempts to 'snuff out the lives of creatures in the area of
effect.' How do you snuff a life, exactly? I sense most of these death
spells take the existence of a soul as a given. In any event, this spell
is best used to kill a host of weaker creatures, or a few moderately
powerful ones. The strongest thing it works on to my recollection are
Umber Hulks, and even then, you'll be lucky to kill even a few. It's
just nowhere near as potent as it was in Baldur's Gate 2, and hence, I
rarely find myself bothering with this spell.

*Disintegrate
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Finally, a single-target death-dealer! Targets who fails to save are
disintegrated, gone, dust. There's no save penalty, but it only needs
to work once.. This spell works on undead creatures, too. Unlike in
Baldur's Gate 2, this spell has no chance of destroying the gear of
the character targeted.

*Flesh to Stone
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Turns a creature to stone unless they save, it's like Disintegrate..
but.. well, the opposite. Same gameplay effects, though. They fail to
save, and they are no more. Again, unlike Baldur's Gate 2, their gear
is not lost when petrified.

*Globe of Invulnerability
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Minor Globe of Invulnerability, but it also protects against 4th-
level spells. And it doesn't use up a precious 4th-level spell slot.
If push comes to shove, I'd go with this spell.

Invisible Stalker
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons an.. Invisible Stalker! In all honesty, the Conjure Elemental
spells are all stronger. The only perk of this spell is that it lasts
two hours, and you can scout around with your summon.

Lich Touch
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Another lame touch-attack, it deals 1-10 damage and forces the target
to save vs paralyzation or be paralyzed. The caster also gains immunity
to paralysis and fear while the spell is active.. but we have better
ways to do that.

Monster Summoning IV
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons 1-3 4th-level monsters:

Ghast
Ogre
Yeti

Otiluke's Freezing Sphere
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Ice = bad. Deals 3-6 cold damage per level of the caster (up to 30-180
damage at level 30). A single save negates all damage.

Power Word: Silence
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The target is silenced for two rounds, no save. Seems like a decent Mage
frustrater, and it is, but its duration is suspect, and it doesn't
necessarily overcome Magic Resistance.

Shades
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like Shadow Monsters and Demishadow Monsters, but again, stronger
versions will be summoned. The monsters shown below may be summoned in
addition to the ones from Shadow Monsters and Demi-Shadow Monsters:

Troll (6th-level)
Troll (7th-level)
Troll (8th-level)
Umber Hulk (8th-level)
Umber Hulk (9th-level)

Soul Eater
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Deals 3d8 (3-24) damage to all living creatures in a 10-foot radius.
If anything dies, the caster gains +1 Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution for one turn (ten rounds), and the dead is reanimated as
a skeleton. Poor damage that doesn't affect undead, has little chance
to kill, and if it does gives minor, short-term buffs to the caster
and summons a weak undead. Yay..

Stone to Flesh
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
If your characters are turned to stone.. you can de-stone them. It's
worth noting that there is no Disintegration reversal spell out there.
Of course, the computer probably never has this spell prepared, so for
you, Flesh to Stone is still a guaranteed killer.

*Tenser's Transformation
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
It's the best single-character buff in the game. On its own, it turns a
Mage into a fighting machine by lowering the THAC0 to Fighter-esque
levels, doubling their Hit Points, giving them an extra attack per
round, giving them a +2 damage bonus, and granting a -4 bonus to Armor
Class. On a multi-or-dual-classed character it improves their already
great Armor Class, adds to their already great damage, doubles their
higher Hit Points, and turns an already good melee Fighter into an
unstoppable engine of destruction. If that character is spell-buffed
beforehand.. well.. you can turn a modest Fighter 12/Mage 13/Cleric 13
character into a 200 Hit Point juggernaut with a -24 Armor Class, a -7
THAC0, four attacks per round, and Saving Throws that vary from -5 to
-8.. and mind you, this is with a mere 3,000,000 experience out of the
possible 22,500,000 experince that character can gain! What more needs
to be said? Buffs making your party unbelievably strong, Tenser's
makes a dual-or-multi-class Fighter/Mage a game-breaker, and together..
It's pretty much what this entire party build of mine is designed to
exploit.

Trollish Fortitude
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Causes the caster to regenerate five Hit Points a round for two turns
(20 rounds). That's 100 Hit Points of gradual healing. It's the best
healing a Mage gets.. but frankly, I'd just stick with Heal.

7th-Level Mage Spells						{SPT025}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Acid Storm: Persistent acid damage.
  ---
Finger of Death: You point, they die.
  ---
Prismatic Spray: Damages, kills, petrifies, or causes insanity.

*Acid Storm
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
All creatures caught in the spell take 1-4 damage (during the first
three rounds), 1-6 (for the next three) and 1-8 (for every round
thereafter). Best deal is, they take this damage even AFTER they leave
the storm until the spell ends. Outside of the storm they are entitled
to a save vs. spells for half damage (for that round). This is an
excellent Troll-killer, just as long as you ensure all Trolls are hit
by it at some point. Combined with bottlenecking.. it can be great fun.

*Finger of Death
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The ultimate death spell, targets save or die, and even if they pass the
save, they take 3-17 damage. I love it.

Malavon's Rage
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
This spell is only useful for its namesake. It functions like Sunburst,
dealing area of effect damage (20-80 points) centered on the caster.

Mass Invisibility
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like the 2nd-level spell Invisibility, but with a 30-foot radius. It has
a few, very few, select uses.

Monster Summoning V
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons 1-3 5th-level monsters:

Giant Spider
Ju-ju Zombie
Minotaur

Mordenkainen's Sword
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons a sword that acts as if it were wielded by a Fighter of half
the level of the caster. Counts as a +2 weapon and deals 5-30 damage
per hit. Unfortunately, the sword is not autonomous in Icewind Dale like
it is in Baldur's Gate 2-it replaces your equipped weapon, and even
though it can be used to attack anything in sight, it's still less
effective than just using your normal weapons, or casting another spell.

Power Word: Stun
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Stuns targets depending upon their Hit Points, as follows:

	o===============o=======================o
	|  Hit Points	|     Stun Duration	|
	o===============o=======================o
	|     < 31	|      4-16 rounds	|
	|---------------|-----------------------|
	|    31 - 60	|       2-8 rounds	|
	|---------------|-----------------------|
	|    61 - 90	|       1-4 rounds	|
	|---------------|-----------------------|
	|     > 90	|      Unaffected	|
	o===============o=======================o

It allows no save, but Magic Resistance applies. In Heart of Fury mode,
everything will have more than 90 Hit Points, making this spell purely
a lower-difficulty spell.

*Prismatic Spray
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creats a long cone of prismatic light that has varying effects on all
caught within it, depending upon the color they were struck with. All
creatures with less than 8 Hit Dice (64 Hit Points) are blinded for 2-8
rounds regardless of whatever else happens:

	o=======o=======================================o
	| Color	|		 Effects		|
	o=======o=======================================o
	|  Red	|       20 damage (save for half)	|
	|-------|---------------------------------------|
	|Orange |	40 damage (save for half)	|
	|-------|---------------------------------------|
	|Yellow	|	80 damage (save for half)	|
	|-------|---------------------------------------|
	| Green	| Save vs. Poison or die, 20 damage on	|
	|	|            successful save		|
	|-------|---------------------------------------|
	| Blue	|Save vs. Petrification or be turned to |
	|	|                 stone			|
	|-------|---------------------------------------|
	|Indigo	|       Save vs. Wand or go insane	|
	o=======o=======================================o

As you can see, the effects are highly variable, and the spell is not
party friendly, but if you're careful, it might be worth a gamble
against a group of foes.

Seven Eyes
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Creates seven eyes that float around the caster, each can be used once,
either defensively or offensively, but afterwards the eye will lose its
power. The spell lasts for two turns (20 rounds). Once cast, access the
special abilities of each eye via the Special Abilities Button.

o==========o===========================================================o
|  Eye of  |Defense: Protects against mental attacks		       |
| the Mind |Offense: Charm Person				       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|  Eye of  |Defense: Deflects one physical attack (like Stoneskin)     |
|the Sword |Offense: Magic Missile (5 missiles)			       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|  Eye of  |Defense: Absorbs one elemental attack		       |
| the Mage |Offense: Lightning Bolt (4d8 damage)		       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|  Eye of  |Defense: Prevents one poisoning effect		       |
|  Venom   |Offense: Poisons a creature, 30 damage over 30 seconds     |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|  Eye of  |Defense: Blocks one instant-death magic attack	       |
|the Spirit|Offense: Ray of Enfeeblement			       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|  Eye of  |Defense: Stops stunning, deafness, blindess, silence effect|
|Fortitude |Offensse: Shout					       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|  Eye of  |Defense: Blocks on petrification attack 		       |
|  Stone   |Offense: Hold Person				       |
o==========o===========================================================o

Suffocate
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Draws the breath out of all creatures in a 10-foot radius and lasts for
four rounds. If a creature does not save, it suffers a -4 penalty to
Armor Class, -4 THAC0, -6 Dexterity, loses one attack per round, moves
at half speed, and suffers 4d8 damage per round. If the target saves,
they take 2d8 damage for one round. Effects fade if the creature moves
out of the area of effect. It is not party friendly, imposes no save
penalty... and it really just sounds like a half-assed Slow spell.

8th-Level Mage Spells						{SPT026}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELLS***
Mind Blank: Protects against mind affecting effects.
  ---
Power Word: Blind: Blinds foes, no save, party friendly.

Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Perhaps no spell has suffered more in Icewind Dale than poor Horrid
Wilting. In Baldur's Gate 2, it was a party friendly super smiter. In
Icewind Dale.. well, it's not party friendly, so it's not safe to use.
It deals 1d8 damage per level of the caster (30-240 damage), allowing a
save for half damage. Watery foes are instantly slain if they fail to
save. On normal difficulty it's still a decent first-strike spell,
but in Heart of Fury, you'll only use it to knock out a few, select
foes.

Greater Shout
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Like shout, but shoutier. It deals 2d4 damage to the caster and they
must save vs. spell or fall unconscious for a turn (10 rounds). That's
one hell of a tax, but is it worth it? Anything caught in it's path
with fewer than 5 Hit Dice (40 Hit Points) are instantly slain.
Anything else must save vs. spell or they are stunned for two rounds,
deafened for four rounds, and suffer 4d12 (4-48) damage. If they save,
they are merely stunned for one round, defeaned for two rounds, and
take 2d12 (2-24) damage. I'd say.. it's not worth it.

Incediary Cloud
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Lasts for five rounds, of which it is harmless for two rounds. On the
third round it ignites, dealing 1-2 damage per level of the caster
(up to 30-60 damage). The second round it deals 1-4 damage per level
of the caster (30-120 damage). Finally, on the third round after
ignition it drops back to 1-2 damage per level of the caster, for a
total of 90-240 damage (save vs. spell for half). Unless you use
multi-Web or Slow, the effect is likely to be minimal. In all honesty,
I prefer Acid Storm.

Iron Body
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
A half-assed Tenser's mixed with a half-assed Stoneskin! The result:
horrible. The caster becomes immune to electricity, 50% resistant to
fire, 25% resistant to crushing damage, and becomes immune to spells
that require respiration (Suffocate, Cloudkill, etc) or affects the
physiology. Also, their Strength is boosted to 25 and they deal 2d4
damage + Strength bonuses with their fists. On the other hand, it
disables spells and you move at 25% normal speed. Why not just use
freakin' Tenser's?

*Mind Blank
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Protects you from all mind-affecting effects-Charm, Command, Domination,
Fear, Feeblemind, and the like. Not terribly common in this game, but
against Umber Hulks and debuffing enemy spell-casters, it's wonderful.
And it lasts an entire day! My entire party keeps one prepared, just
because they can.

Monster Summoning VI
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Summons 1-3 6th-level monsters:

Carrion Crawler
Phase Spider
Frost Salamander
Salamander
Troll
Yuan-ti Elite

*Power Word: Blind
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Blinds all enemies in a 10-foot radius. No save, no Hit Point
thresholds, lasts for one turn (10 rounds). A pretty handy debuff for
a Mage.

9th-Level Mage Spells						{SPT027}
o======================================================================o
***TOP SPELL***
Monster Summoing VII: Summons moderately tough monsters.

*Monster Summoning VII
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
The winner of the 9th-level spell content by default, this spell summons
1-2 7th or 8th level monsters. I told you 9th-level spells weren't
very impressive in Icewind Dale. Where the hell is Time Stop, Meteor
Swarm, or Wish?

Boneguard Skeleton
Umber Hulk

Power Word: Kill
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Kills targets depending upon their Hit Points-one creature with up to
60 Hit Points, or multiple creatures with fewer than 30, up to a maximum
of 120 Hit Points worth. It uses current Hit Points to determine, not
maximum, so strong wounded foes can be affected.. but again, in Heart
of Fury, this spell will have little to no effect.

Spell Buff Order						{SPT029}
o======================================================================o
Now you know what spells to have, and why to have them, but apparently
this isn't enough for some people. Some people know who they are, but
I tolerate them because they're usually right when it comes to these
things. Anyhow, in this section we'll discuss what spells to use-when,
and in what order you should cast your buffs. What kind of lazy ass FAQ-
writer wouldn't put this information in the walkthrough, you know, when
you fight creatures that require buffing? Beats me, I made sure to put
it in the walkthrough, but here you'll find a stable, easy-to-find
location that discusses spell-buffing in more detail. I see the appeal,
I follow FAQs myself (on games I can't bother to learn everything about
myself or play twice-JRPGs, for example) and it's a pain in the ass to
have to scroll through a walkthrough to find the author's off-hand
comments on how to do something that should really be mentioned in its
own context.

Since I went through such great effort to advocate a specific party
build for this guide, I'll use this party as a basis for my buffing
strategies. If you don't like my party, devise your own damn buffing
strategy, and for that matter, write your own damn guide, if you know
better. With a party consisting of five Fighter/Mage/Clerics and a
Fighter/Mage/Thief, you can bet that buffing is absolutely essential.

Buff Combo: General Buffing					{SPT030}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
As I said earlier, I have six Mages and five Clerics in my party, so
spell-buffing is essential before every big fight. My party is really
built around the buff-they're capable of annhilating anything if buffed
properly. If they're not, they're a little on the weak side. Since
buffing is essential, knowing what you're doing is important. In harder
difficulties, buffs are required all the time. This strategy, then,
includes the better, longer-lasting buffs that are worth having on all
the time. Notably absent from this list are spells that result in
fatigue-namely Haste and Righteous Wrath of the Faithful. They're
superior buffs, but since you need to rest after their effects wear off,
they're not useful for general buffing. If you find these buffs
insufficient to see yourself through an area, repeat rounds #3-#5, as
buffs wear off. Obviously as you continue to level up, you'll be able
to prepare more of these spells, and they'll each last longer. There's
really no such thing as a dead level when you're a triple-classer.

Round #1: Stoneskin
       (Stoneskin is one of the longest-lasting buffs in the game, so
	it should ALWAYS go first.)
Round #2: Mirror Image
       (At three rounds per level, this is another great defensive Mage
	buff that will last for a long time.)
Round #3: Prayer, Recitation, Emotion: Hope, Emotion: Courage,
	  Protection from Evil 10' Radius
       (All of these are party buffs which-thanks to my great number of
	spell-casters-can be applied in a single round. Most of them
	only last one round per level, but that's still a good bit of
	time, especially if you rush.)
Round #4: Entropy Shield
       (A great Cleric-only buff. It too lasts one round per level.)
Round #5: Draw Upon Holy Might
       (Lasting only one turn-ten rounds-this is the last buff I apply.
	I might not care to use this due to its duration, but the
	benefits it gives to THAC0, damage, and Hit Points make it a
	wonderful buff.)

Buff Combo: Spell Buff to the Max!				{SPT031}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
You'll see this phrase use a few times throughout the guide-the phrase
came before the section, honest. This is the general spell-buffing you
will use in most major fights. Pretty much every time I mention the need
to buff in the guide, I intend for you to use this. You only really need
the General Buff for Heart of Fury mode, where most every encounter is
potentially threatening. You spell buff to the max for big encounters.

Round #1: Stoneskin
       (Stoneskin is one of the longest-lasting buffs in the game, so
	it should ALWAYS go first.)
Round #2: Mirror Image
       (At three rounds per level, this is another great defensive Mage
	buff that will last for a long time.)
Round #3: Prayer, Recitation, Emotion: Hope, Emotion: Courage,
	  Protection from Evil 10' Radius
       (All of these are party buffs which-thanks to my great number of
	spell-casters-can be applied in a single round. Most of them
	only last one round per level, but that's still a good bit of
	time, especially if you rush.)
Round #4: Entropy Shield, Haste
       (A great Cleric-only buff. It too lasts one round per level.
	Haste also goes on now, which lasts three rounds plus one round
	per level. It needs to proceed Righteous Wrath of the Faithful
	for their effects to stack-and you want them to stack.)
Round #5: Draw Upon Holy Might
       (Lasting only one turn-ten rounds-this buff just needs to go now,
	as further buffing will prevent me from buffing further.)
Round #6: Tenser's Transformation, Righteous Wrath of the Faithful
       (Some-but not all-of my characters cast Tenser's Transformation,
	the uber-buff of the game. The downside? They cannot cast
	anything else during its effects. I don't want to deprive my
	party of healers, so at most three of my Fighter/Mage/Clerics
	and my Fighter/Mage/Thief use this spell-which leaves me two
	potential healers/rebuffers. One of them casts Righteous Wrath
	of the Faithful.

Buff Combo: The Quick Buff					{SPT032}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Sometimes, the enemy will bring nasty, nasty Dispel Magic to bear-like
in the final fight of the game. When pre-emptive spell-buffing is
impossible, the quick buff is needed.

Round #1: Greater Shield of Lathander
       (At least one character gets this spell up and tries to make
	themselves a target. It's a wonderful Cleric spell that will
	make you immune to damage for three rounds-three rounds will
	have to do.
Round #2: Prayer, Recitation, Emotion: Hope, Emotion: Courage,
	  Protection from Evil 10' Radius, Haste
       (These spells are all multi-target and have a decent duration.
	They might not be the strongest personal buffs, but since each
	spell can benefit the whole party, they go now, and all
	together, they are a tremendous benefit.)
Round #3: Stoneskin, Righteous Wrath of the Faithful
       (If you can spare a third round, get up Stoneskins, the best
	physical defense, and be sure to hit everybody with a Righteous
	Wrath of the Faithful, as it's one of the best offensive buffs
	in the game.)

o======================================================================o
|								       |
|			    My Party {PTY001}			       |
|								       |
o======================================================================o
Yes, I play lots of D&D, and yes, I wrote a biography for each of them.
I am aware I have no life. With that out of the way, the reason I
decided to make this party is simple. In the original game, dual-
classing was the way to go. With a mere 250,000 experience you could get
most of the Fighter bonuses without losing too much from the second
class you dual-classed into. With the Heart of Winter expansion
installed, however, multi-classed character take over due to their
absurdly high experience cap. The big debate (going on in my head...
I'm not insane, it's called an inner monologue) was between dual-and-
multi-classed characters... so I'll describe the two options and reveal
why, in the end, I went with multi-classed characters after six
playthroughs and three versions of the guide based on dual-classed
characters.

Multi-Class Versus Dual-Class					{PTY002}
o======================================================================o
The idea behind dual-classing is simple-get as many Fighter levels as
possible (29), then switch to your secondary class... usually Cleric or
Mage. This makes an uber-strong spell-caster who can use more weapons,
has Grand Mastery, more Hit Points, a better THAC0, and (in the case of
the Fighter/Mage) better armor selection. There is one huge downside,
however. To pull this off, you will have to grind a very, very, very
long time. I found out even I have my limits-power gameyness is not
worth spending days grinding to reach level 29 as a Fighter, then to
reach level 30 as a Mage or Cleric. Playing through the game with weak
hybrid characters who won't come into their own until they've obtained
the 5,250,000 experience required to hit level 29 as a Fighter AND the
4,950,000 required to reach level 30 as a Cleric or the 7,500,000
required to hit level 30 as a Mage is just silly. But before I cast my
power-gamey badge into the fire, let's look at the multi-class
alternative. What exactly are the differences between dual-and-multi
class characters, taken to the extreme?

A Fighter/Mage/Cleric multi-class will have the same armor selection
and the same THAC0 as either the Fighter/Mage or Fighter/Cleric dual-
classes. A big difference is that the dual-classers can Grand Master
in weapons, while multi-classed Fighters can only Specialize in weapons.
The difference here is simple-a Specialized character will get +1 to
THAC0 and +2 to damage, with three attacks every two rounds. A character
with Grand Mastery will get +3 THAC0 and +5 damage, with two attacks
per round. On the other hand, the multi-classed character will not have
to waste time grinding-ever. I cannot over-emphasize how much more
gamer-friendly that makes this party. But we're talking about power
comparisons-a Fighter/Mage/Cleric will get fully developed Clerical
spells... like the ability to cast Heal, Symbol of Hopelessness,
Entropy Shield, and Righteous Wrath of the Faithful. They also get
all the great Mage buffs-Mirror Image, Haste, Emotion: Courage, Emotion:
Hope, Stoneskin, Improved Invisibility, and the absolutely game-breaking
Tenser's Transformation. A dual-classed character, of course, can only
have one spell class (and keep the great Fighter perks, anyways.) The
sheer versatility means one important thing-each Fighter/Mage/Cleric can
buff more than any dual-classed character, and ALL your multi-classed
characters will have the ability to cast Heal OR go into an insanely
powerful bout of Tenser's Transformation. In my mind, this tactical
versatility makes up for the lack of Grand Mastery. Besides that, the
only other downside to multi-classing is the maximum Hit Points-
the dual-classed Fighter/Cleric will have 188 Hit Points, and the
dual-classed Fighter/Mage will have 187, while the multi-classed
Fighter/Mage/Thief can aspire to 154-a difference of over thirty points
(which will only be doubled when you use Tenser's).

Anyways, versatility is my excuse for multi-classing, and convenience.
Below I'll detail the characters I played through the game with. These
new, 7th-playthrough characters are VERY power-gamey, designed with
Heart of Fury in mind.

o=======================o=======o=======o=======o=======o=======o======o

  -->	All characters should be good aligned so they can equip the
	Shimmering Sash and Three White Doves.

  -->	All Fighter/Mage/Clerics MUST be Half-Elves. Half-Elves and
	Elves will be able to use The Argent Shield, the best shield in
	the game.

  -->	All characters should be of the same alignment to make the most
	of the Clerical spell 'Righteous Wrath of the Faithful'.

  -->	Gender is unimportant, but nobody wants a sausage-fest.
	Besides, there are only so many good portraits and voices to
	go around.

  -->	Spread out your proficiencies-all your Clerics should be
	Specialized in Maces, but for their secondary weapon,
	alternate between Flails and Hammers. It would be a shame if
	you found a +3 Flail or Hammer you couldn't use because you
	didn't have any points in the proficiency.

  -->	Keep in mind that most of your characters will NOT be Mages
	in any real sense of the word on the first playthrough. You
	will get enough spell scrolls during the game to make one
	character fully useable as a Mage, while another will get a
	mediocore spellbook full of duplicates. That being the case,
	do not be afraid to don heavy armor on your neglected
	characters, as you really aren't losing anything by not having
	access to Mage spells. Only through multiple playthroughs will
	you get enough scrolls for everybody to be a worthwhile Mage
	AND good armor that allows you to cast spells.

  -->	If you are worried about the fact that five of our characters
	will basically be gameplay clones of each other... just pretend
	this is Final Fantasy VIII. Yeah, all our characters magically
	grew up in the same orphanage as each other, but then they used
	too many GFs and got amnesia. Damn. But then they all just so
	happened to reunite and save the world! What a coincidence! Oh,
	yeah, spoilers alert. Don't worry, the game sucks anyways.

  -->	You're in Icewind Dale, so make up some characters with
	appropriatly 'frosty' names. See my "Ilnathias 'Icefang'"?
	Pure class. You know it's cold where he lives, and that he's a
	pure badass. Do NOT make Drizzt Do'Urden, however. That is lame,
	and anachronistic. Besides, 'Drizzt' backwards is 'Tzzird',
	which sounds like Snoop Dog saying 'turd'. No poop-named ebonics
	Dark Elves. You have an imagination, use it.

Here are how my characters will look when I head into Heart of Fury mode
with them-this is after six runs through the game to get them all the
best gear, full spell-books, and enough experience to max them all out
at levels 30/30/30. In addition to the gear listed, each character also
has a Ring of Free Action, a Ring of Fire Resistance, Boots of
Grounding, Boots of the North, and a Fire Flail +3 to use as the
situation demands. Syrenil uses a Long Sword of Action +4, a Long
Bow +4: Hammer, or Lover as her weapons.

Confessions 							{PTY011}

o======================================================================o
Now to come clean. I used the Dalekeeper mod for cosmetic reasons. It
fit the 'personality' of some of my characters to have the Mage or
Thief sprite instead of the Fighter sprite. This mod has been extremely
easy to use and effective, and I recommend it to anybody who is
interested. Thanks to Mr. Aaron O'Neil for creating this mod, and to
sorcerers.net for hosting it.

I considered using various ease-of-use mods, especially ones that help
with inventory management. And by help, I mean 'eliminate'. Really, for
a game of this nature, constantly fiddling with stacks of arrows and
reorganizing your inventory.. it's not a fun part of the game, 'reality'
aside. If anything it slows things down and needlessly complicates the
real meat of the game-the adventure. In any case, I decided not to, so
I could avoid the problem of telling where the game ends and the mod
begins. I do suggest that players who plan to play archers use an
ease-of-use mod to stack the arrows. Having to run back to town to get
more arrows every other fight just makes missiles a pain in the ass.
This is especially true for Heart of Fury mode.. you might as well not
even bring an archer along if you're dealing with ammunition stacks of
fourty-you'll burn through your entire stash every other battle.

This party will be very weak on the outset for the simple fact that as
triple-classed characters their level progression will be very slow.
A single-classed party will be at least one level higher during the
sensitive lower-level phases of the game. There's a huge difference
between a triple-classed Fighter/Mage/Cleric with 4000 experience and a
single-classed Fighter with 4000 experience.. about a four-fold
difference in Hit Points, to be exact. Mid-way through the game,
however, when both characters have around 400,000 experience, the
tables will have turned. Our multi-classed character is now a
Fighter 8/Mage 9/Cleric 8. The multi-classer will have over 80 Hit
Points, but a Fighter with the same experience will be level 9 and
enjoying 126 Hit Points (all Hit Point figures here assume a base 18
Constitution and max Hit Points per level). Still, the Fighter used to
have +300% more Hit Points, but now only has +50% more, and the ratio
is going to keep dwindling (although the single-classed Fighter, and
hence, the dual-class Fighter, will always have more). In exchange, the
Fighter/Mage/Cleric is able to cast 5th-level Mage and Cleric spells.
The Fighter might be a brutal combat butcher, but the multi-classer is
a versatile and sophisticated strategic surgeon, and one Righteous Wrath
of the Faithful spell does more to help your party-and one Chaos does
more to hinder the enemy-than anything a Fighter could hope to do all
fight, much less in one round. You'll just have to pamper them at the
beginning-if they get hurt, withdraw them and heal them. They won't have
the Hit Points to throw around at the beginning of the game. By mid-game
their spells are making up for their lack of Hit Points, and towards the
end you won't be feeling any multi-class blues at all.

Winter's Cradle Tavern (AR1006)/ Cellar (AR1015)
o======================================================================o
1) Your adventure begins, as do all good adventures, in a tavern.
Hrothgar will speak to the party briefly, then leave. He does the
typical nice guy sheriff routine-welcome, but watch your ass while in
my town. You can talk to Hildreth Highhammer (x=800, y=500) about the
expedition if you wish, or any of the townspersons for that matter. In
fact, if you talk to normal townsfolk enough you'll get briefed on just
about every quest we'll tackle in town.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Talk to Grisella (x=590, y=320) north of the bar, and ask for some
spirits. Get her to tell you about her beetle problem, and agree to help
remedy the situation. Oh boy! Our first quest!

Note: It doesn't matter how you get this quest-be nice, be greedy,
whatever. There is a global variable "Grisella_Cash" that pops up if
you demand more money.. but it doesn't seem to do anything at all.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Head down the stairs (x=900, y=300) to the cellar, where you'll find
four Beetles. Unlike most foes in this game, they won't fight back, so
if you want to be desperate and scrounge for extra experience points,
just raise the difficulty before bashing them.. eventually. Yay, you
survived your totally non-threatening combat tutorial. The developers
are now confident that you have a pulse. Head back upstairs and talk to
Grisella to claim your reward.

***REWARD***
(Because you bashed the bottle-bogarting basement beetles)
EXP	1200
Gold	5

Note: I figure I might as well say it now, for you greedy folks out
there. Raising the difficulty DOES increase the quest experience you
gain. I knew this before I had Infinity Explorer, but by taking a quick
gander you can see it at work indisputably. Complete this quest and the
following occurs: AddXPVar("Level_1_Easy",14978"). Note that the 'Easy'
in the variable doesn't refer to the game difficulty, but the quest
difficulty. Since most of the quests in Easthaven require little in the
way of combat, if you want to maximize your experience gains, you might
as well raise the difficulty before turning in experience rewards. This
is a good idea throughout the game, in fact. Monsters also give more
experience points on harder difficulties, but that actually does require
a bit more effort on our part. These Beetles, however, are a rare
exception-they won't fight back. If you up the difficulty, you'll get
more experience for smashing them. If you switch to Heart of Fury mode
for this 'fight' you'll get over 2000 experience per bug. Seriously.
It'll just take a while for you to kill them. Do what you will. All
experience rewards listed for quests will be those gained on the normal
difficulty setting.

Easthaven (AR1000)
o======================================================================o
4) The town of Easthaven and.. well, it's a dump. Like all games of this
type, there are plenty of little quests to do to get us in the RPG
spirit, and places to explore.. and of course, shopping. Being unarmored
and wielding Quarter Staves is not the path to success, people. We'll
get to shopping shortly. First, however, head into Hrothgar's House,
(x=2000, y=350) past the Fishmonger's (which we need not bother with
yet).

Hrothgar's House (AR1004)
o======================================================================o
5) The obvious thing to do here is, of course, talk to Hrothgar. He'll
invite you on the expedition south, and you can accept a quest to search
for an overdue caravan. The Fishmonger also has some interest in this
caravan, but since we won't get anything out of talking to him now, we
can just wait to bother with the Fishmonger. You can steal a few things
from Hrothgar's house, but be careful and save. Hrothgar going hostile
ends the main quest, so be sure not to save the game unless you succeed.

***ITEMS***
(x=320, y=420) Short Bow, Arrows x20
(x=370, y=550) Scribbled Note
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Head south from Hrothgar's House to find a 'Townsperson' standing
around (x=1450, y=1030). Talk to this Jhonen, and listen to him
complain about his dreams. Be nice to him and offer to help, and stay
honest with him on this quest. Not because you're good people, but
because a super awesome sword *MIGHT* depend on how you handle this
quest. Or maybe not, how would I know?

Temple of Tempus (AR1001)
o======================================================================o
7) Now, let's get more story out of the way by visting the Temple of
Tempus, to the west (x=550, y=550). Inside the temple you can speak to
Everard about Jarrod's Stone, and to Accalia about Tempus in general.
The former is relevent to the story.. or it will be, eventually. The
latter is just mindless Forgotten Realms flavor. You can also steal two
potions of healing from Everard.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) Exit the temple and head south and you'll eventually happen upon
Aspel the Scrimshander (x=770, y=1810). He'll ask you to get rid of a
Wolf that broke into his house. Head to the locked door (x=1120, y=1720)
and either pick the lock or bash the door open, then head inside.

Scrimshander's Workshop (AR1010)
o======================================================================o
9) Once inside you'll immediately be attacked by the feral Wolf. Smite
it-unlike the Beetles earlier it'll fight back, but that doesn't mean
it's much of a threat. Once done, head outside and tell Aspel that his
Wolf problem has been resolved for a quest reward.

***REWARD***
(For whuppin' the wild Wolf in the workshop)
EXP	1200
Gold	25
Item	Aspel's Dagger*1

*1: Apsel's Dagger is a non-magical dagger that gives a +1 bonus to
THAC0. It's pretty standard fare to find such petty weapons near the
beginning of the game.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Continue Southwest to reach the shore, along which you'll find a
'Strange Blue-Skinned Woman' (x=150, y=2630). Could it be, perhaps, the
woman from Jhonen's dream? Of course it is, how often do blue-skinned
women just wander around the beach? She'll give you a sword that
belonged to one of Jhonen's ancestors and ask you to return it to him.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Time to humor her and resolve this quest. Go talk to Jhonen and tell
him you discovered the reason for his dreams. You'll get one of two
options-either lie and tell him that the Elisia-the blue-skinned lady-
is trying to kill him and that the cure is to give up all his worldly
possessions (sounds like religion!), or you can tell him the truth and
hand over the broken useless blade. I strongly suggest the latter path.
Being good is its own reward, surely, but even better than that, it'll
endow you with a real reward later.

***REWARD***
(For lying to Jhonen)
EXP	1200
Item	Knucklehead Trout x3 (sell for 25gp each), Dagger. Not to
	mention you can sell the Shattered Blade of Aihonen for 75gp.

  ---or---

***REWARD***
(For telling Jhonen the truth)
EXP 	1200
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Now you can go back to Elisia. If you chose to lie, you can continue
to do so and get more rewards. If you actually told Jhonen the truth,
you'll get the same monetary reward, plus some experience for being a
good person.

***REWARD***
(For lying to Elisia)
Item	Pearl (sell for 100gp)

  ---or---

***REWARD***
(For telling Elisia you delivered the blade of Aihonen to Johnen)
EXP	1200
Item	Pearl (sell for 100gp)

House (AR1013)
o======================================================================o
13) Head into the house across from Aspel's Warehouse (x=310, y=1850)
and open the box at (x=400, y=150) for a Winter Wolf Pelt. This former
puppy sells for 250 gold. It'll come in hand when we go shopping,
shortly. Now, let's head over to Old Jed's House (x=1980, y=1220).

***ITEMS***
(x=400, y=150) Winter Wolf Pelt

Old Jed's House (AR1009)
o======================================================================o
14) Really the only thing to do is talk to Old Jed (x=360, y=280). He'll
ask you to buy him some wine from Pomab's. Agree to help his raging
alcoholism and gain even more incentive to visit Pomab's Emporium. I'll
list the quest reward, below, for when you return with Jed's hooch.
Now, for one last stop before we go shopping head to the Snowdrift Inn
(x=3200, y=1300).

***REWARD***
(For helping Old Jeb stay off the wagon)
EXP	1200
Gold	6

Snowdrift Inn (AR1008)
o======================================================================o
15) You can chat to the enthusiastic Quimby (x=550, y=640, and rent a
room if you're hurt. You can also find an 'Elf' (x=550, y=230) named
Erevain Blacksheaf, who complains about the weather. Elves-a race of
pansies if I ever saw one. Best of all, you can score a little bit of
extra loot for your imminent shopping spree. Once done, go visit Pomab's
Emporium.

***ITEMS***
(x=720, y=230) Skydrop Gem
(x=1030, y=480) 13 gold

Pomab's Emporium (AR1007)/(AR1016)
o======================================================================o
16) Pomab (x=790, y=500) will sell you the basic gear you'll need, and
he's a real charmer besides. You'll probably have no qualms about
robbing his bookshelves upstairs (x=1000, y=500). Splint Mail is a
really good purchase for your fighters at this point in the game, and
anybody who can wear a Helmet should. Depending on your play style, you
might also be interested in a variety of other items. With a high
Dexterity, Splint Mail, and a Shield, your Armor Class could be -1. Not
bad at this level. Make sure to buy some wine for Old Jed, and sell off
the loot you've found. If you're playing Heart of Winter, you'll want to
pick up any storage devices you can grab. They'll help keep your
inventory clean, trust me.

***ITEMS*** (AR1016)
(x=450, y=200) Tchazar Gem x6, High Quality Dagger
(x=350, y=150) Potion of Healing, Scroll of Sleep*1,
	       Scroll of Chromatic Orb

*1: This spell will prove very handy against the orcs and goblins you'll
fight later. As a general rule of thumb, I give all scrolls to Syrenil
first, since she's my dedicated archer and doesn't wear much armor,
she's the most suited to taking up the role of party Mage.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
17) For a point of reference, this is how my party is decked out when
they leave Pomab's Emporium:

Ilnathias 'Icefang':	Splint Mail Armor
			Helmet
			Flail
			Large Shield

Amirule Alteslay:	Splint Mail Armor
			Helmet
			Morning Star
			Medium Shield

Kaelinalia:		Splint Mail Armor
			Helmet
			Morning Star
			Small Shield

Nauzhir the Red		Chain Mail Armor
			Helmet
			Mace
			Buckler

Eraithul		Chain Mail Armor
			Helmet
			Flail
			Buckler

Syrenil 'Softstep'	Studded Leather Armor
			Helmet
			Composite Long Bow
			Arrows x400

The first five characters-the Fighter/Mage/Clerics, all will serve duty
as front-line Fighters, while Syrenil 'Softstep' will stay back as an
archer. For now, our spell-power is so low that we're better off just
wearing heavy armor. Later on in the game we'll find Bracers of Defense,
Mage Robes, and Elven Chain Mail that will allow us to cast our Mage
spells while remaining well-defended.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
18) Head south across the bridge. A scared boy (Damien) will tell you
about monsters in the town. Agree to help him get his catch back and
head south to find some Goblins. They think they're sneaky and want you
to walk east to reach them, where they'll take great pleasure in
shooting at you. I just shoot down their archers and wait for their
melee Goblins to come to me. They'll drop a variety of sellable loot,
and the Goblin Elite will drop a Knucklehead Trout, as well as something
random, 1st play he gave me a suit of Scale Mail Armor, 2nd play he gave
me a High Quality Morning Star, and 3rd play he gave me a Potion of
Healing, and on yet another playthrough I got a High Quality Dagger...
bottom line, you'll get something of the sort. Give the fish back to the
boy to complete the quest.. Or you could also keep the fish and sell it
yourself for 25 gold.

***REWARD***
(Give Damien the remains of his fish)
EXP	1200

Orc Caves, Exterior (AR1200)
o======================================================================o
19) Now, it's time to go looking for that missing caravan, meaning now
I have to do the obligatory 'leaving the area' tutorial. Go back to
where you killed the Goblins and proceed to the eastern edge of the
map. Move your cursor near the edge of the map and the icon will change
to a travel wheel. Click on it, and boom-you're in another area. Cool,
eh? Make sure you have enough ammunition for a few fights. Also, if
you've done all the quests in Easthaven and manipulated the difficulty,
most of your characters (all my Fighters, for example) should have hit
level two. The doubled Hit Points will help.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
20) From where you appear head north and west. There will be some Wolves
to kill, and behind them some caravan carts outside of a cave
(x=200, y=250). Somehow, I don't think things are looking good for this
caravan. If you're quick, you'll see an Orc run into the cave ahead of
you. By all means, follow him. Orcs are well-known to be helpful to
travelers looking for sacked caravans.

Orc Caves, Interior (AR1201)
o======================================================================o
21) When you enter you'll be accosted by some Orcs. My super-strong
party makes quick work of them before continuing north. Smite a handful
of Orcs at a fork and explore to the west, considering north is a dead-
end. The western path opens into a large chamber, with quite a few Orcs
milling around. I think it's safe to call this the first real fight in
the game, even though it's still not difficult. You'll find an Orc
Shaman here who will try to cast some buffs on his buddies, and/or
debuffs on you. He's really nothing more than a nuisance, making him one
of the few spell-casters you can afford to ignore. Slay them all, loot,
and explore to the south to find a crate with some toys inside.

***ITEMS***
(x=2170, y=1570) Fire Agate Gem, Lynx Eye Gem,
		 Scroll of Protection from Petrification*1

*1: Mage scrolls are handy little devices that allow you to cast the
spell on the scroll without using spell slots. On the other hand, if you
scribe the scroll into a spellbook, that spell is added permenantly into
your repertoire, and can be cast as many times as it's memorized. Save
ALL mage scrolls you get. They're invaluable, especially with so many
hungry Mages greedily eyeing every scroll we find.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
22) From the large room you're in, explore to the northwest to find a
lone Orc standing at a fork in the tunnel. Slay it, then explore to the
east to find another Orc Shaman and some cronies to kill. Backtrack and
explore the northern-most of the two western options to find three Orcs
guarding a chest. Make the Orcs dead, and the chest yours.

***ITEMS***
(x=450, y=650) 97 gold, Silver Necklace, ~Ring of Lesser Resistance*1
	       (3rd Play: Fire Dagger*2)
	       (4th Play: Girdle of Beatification*3)
	       (7th Play: Quiet Boots*4)
	       (7-X Play: Ring of Protection +1*5)

Note: Items in the ***ITEMS*** section that have the ~ symbol in front
of them are random loot. When alternatives have been found, they'll be
listed below the item list, along the with the playthrough in which they
were found. In the above list the ~Ring of Lesser Resistance is the
random item I originally found. 7th Play: Quiet Boots means that on my
7th playthrough of the game I found Quiet BOots instead of the Ring of
Lesser Resistance.

*1: This guy gives a +2 bonus on all saves versus spells. Put it on one
of your front-line characters, who are more likely to suffer from
hostile magic.
  ---
*2: This Dagger gives you a +2 bonus to THAC0 and has a +15% chance of
dealing 1d4 fire damage. Any and all weapons that deal fire damage
should be kept, as they make keeping Trolls down easier.. at least, if
you don't want to buy Arrows of Fire for the purpose.
  ---
*3: A belt that gives its wearer the benefit of a Bless spell, namely
a +1 bonus to THAC0.
  ---
*4: These humble boots give a +7% bonus to Stealth. Eh.. I'd rather have
the ring, but there's no harm in throwing them on Syrenil.
  ---
*5: This ring gives you a +1 bonus to Armor Class and Saves. Pretty
decent for our level, but we'll find (steal) a superior ring later on.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
23) Backtrack to the fork again and head down the Southwestern path.
Kill some Orcs, and continue traveling Southwest, then south, as the
path changes. Orcs need death, and eventually you'll reach another large
chamber to the south. Here you'll find your first truly threatening
creature-an Ogre. If you've leveled by now, your superior Hit Points
will serve you well, as Ogres pack quite a punch. Don't let injured
characters tangle with the Ogre, withdrawing them as necessary. The
Orcs are just distractions-take down the Ogre first, then mop up. Use
spells like Sleep or Command to put the Ogre out of the fight. Once
everything is dead, loot-the Ogre will drop the note 'Caravan Contract',
and a Potion of Healing. There's also a chest with your name on it to
the east.

***HoF***
In Insane difficulty or Heart of Fury mode, you'll find three
additional Ogres here. For a fresh party, spells are essential here..
and a great deal of luck. Without Sleep, Entangle, or Command: Die,
you've got little chance of winning on Insane difficulty, as these
Ogres are probably going to kill you in one hit. On the other hand,
strong parties replaying this area, or in Heart of Fury mode have
nothing to fear. Each of the extra Ogres will drop a Winter Wolf Pelt,
along with some token coinage.

***ITEMS***
(x=1500, y=1800) Winter Wolf Pelt, 43 gold, Scroll of Horror

Fishmonger's House (AR1005)
o======================================================================o
24) Well, that was fun. Head back to town, sell off your booty, and go
visit the Fishmonge (Gaspar), who lives between Hrogthgar and the
Winter's Cradle Inn at (x=2470, y=400). Show him evidence of the
caravan's demise and you'll get yourself some more quest experience.
Time to report to Hrothgar.

***REWARD***
(For showing Gaspar evidence of the caravan's demise)
EXP	1200
Gold	25
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
25) Talk to Hrothgar and tell him the fate of the caravan. In return,
he'll kindly send you on another mission-to pick up supplies for the
expedition from Pomab's Emporium. Hurray. So.. head over to Pomab's
Emporium and talk to Pomab, give him the 'Supply List' list for some
more experience. Go back to Hrothgar to leave Easthaven.

***REWARD***
(For telling Hrothgar about the caravan)
EXP	2400
Item	Supply List

***QUEST***
(For giving the shopping list to Pomab)
EXP	1200

o======================================================================o
|								       |
|			     Kuldahar Pass 			       |
|								       |
o======================================================================o
It's a short-lived expedition, as one might expect. Enroute to Kuldahar
our group is attacked by Frost Giants. Predictably, everybody save our
humble batch of protagonists finds themselves buried under an avalanche.
I suppose in this part of the world, it's more of an occupational
hazard, really. Still, we're not a terribly impressive bunch yet-the
best hope for Kuldahar will never arrive. We just have to hope that
whatever happens, we are allowed to hone ourselves against weak foes,
and somehow continue to gradually increase our might against
escalatingly more powerful enemies before encountering whatever is
behind Kuldahar's troubles. But what are the odds of THAT happening?

Kuldahar Pass, South (AR2000)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK002}
		1) Post Avalanche Hermit
		2) Goblin Genocide
		3) Huge Ogre Headache
		4) More Monster Mayhem
		5) Beetle Cave Beatdown
		6) Goblin Marshal Migrane
		7) Orc-Occupied Mill
		8) Out of the Closet
		9) Goblin Tower

1) After a cutscene a Hermit will come speak with you. He'll point you
in the direction of Kuldahar and warn you of Goblins. There are indeed
plenty of Goblins about, but they really pose no threat and warrant no
special strategy to beat. We could make right for Kuldahar as soon as
possible, but why skip out on any loot and experience?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Head east along a road, and at a fork you'll find some Goblins
waiting. Shoot them down and head along the northern road and find more
Goblins. To the east you'll find a ruined farmhouse and.. even more
Goblins. Loot the barrel near the farmhouse for a Potion of Healing
and continue east to find a river bed bridged by two.. well, bridges.
The northern bridge is a small, unimpressive wooden structure that
leads to a mill, while the southern bridge is.. well, small, stone,
and unimpressive, and it'll take you to Kuldahar. Along the way-Goblins,
Goblins everywhere! Kill whatever Goblins you find, loot, and collect
yourself on the road on the western side of the river bed.

***HoF***
The enemies haven't changed, only their number. You can expect there
to be more Goblins around than usual.

***ITEMS***
(x=2180, y=1300) Potion of Healing

Ghereg's Tower (AR2003)
o======================================================================o
3) Head north along the road and follow it when it turns west-kill
whatever Goblins dare to stand in your way-and you'll eventually come
across a tower (x=1720, y=750). Inside of this tower is an ogre named
Ghereg (x=300, y=320) who has a headache. You can't help him right now,
and if you wish to help him later, you shouldn't provoke him. Why help
an Ogre? Quest experience, of course!

Kuldahar Pass, North (AR2001)
o======================================================================o
4) Continue around Ghereg's Tower along the path until you find an
area transition along the north of the map (x=1500, y=100). In this area
you'll find a bunch of Goblins (many of which are archers) preying upon
some beetles. Against a party packing this much martial prowess, they
really don't stand a chance, but if you want to pretend that there are
some tactics involved, casting a Sleep spell will simplify matters. When
all the goblins are dead enter the cave at (x=1200, y=200).

Kuldahar Pass, Beetle Cave (AR2002)
o======================================================================o
5) Inside are some beetles munching on some goblins. You can easily
dispose of them one at a time, as they won't attack unless you attack
them. Once you're done, search the goblin bodies (x=150, y=330) and
(x=505, y=405) for some gold, nine Arrows +1, and a Jasper Gem. Now
leave the cave (x=200, y=500) and head back to Kuldahar Pass
(x=200, y=950) (AR2000).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Return to the northern (wooden) bridge to the east and cross it.
Put down any Goblins that are still alive around the mill and talk to
a Goblin Marshal (x=3400, y=470), if you wish. He's got much the same
problem as poor Ghereg. Too bad nobody cares about goblins and ogres,
right? Loot a barrel (x=3000, y=670) for a Potion of Healing before
entering the door behind the talkative Goblin Marshal (x=3250, y=400).

***ITEMS***
(x=3000, y=670) Potion of Healing

***ITEM FISHING***
It's not too important, but in the Mill you'll encounter an Orc named
Uligar, who can drop-among other things-the shield Stoutward. It's not
a game-changing item, but it is one of the better shields you'll be able
to get for a while. Quick-Save before entering, kill Uligar, and if he
drops a shield, you're gold. If not, reload and try, try again. You can
also score Glimglam's Cloak, which is another decent low-level
protection item.

Mill (AR2004)
o======================================================================o
7) Inside the mill (AR2004) an orc named Uligar will demand tribute.
You can pay him 50 gold to avoid a fight, or just kill him and his crew.
By far the easier choice is killing him. Uligar and his cronies have
assorted loot, including a Scroll of Blur and a random item drop-I've
found the following;

(1st Play: The Merry Shorthorn*1)
(2nd Play: Stoutward*2)
(4th Play: Wand of Trap Detection*3)
(6th Play: Applebane*4)
(7th Play: Glimglam's Cloak*5)

There are some stairs down at (x=340, y=160.)

*1: This Bardic toy allows its user to cast Bless once per day. Any
Cleric can do the same.
  ---
*2: Stoutward gives a +2 armor class bonus, but no missile bonus. Still,
a full-time Armor Class bonus of two is nice for now. I put it on my
third Fighter/Cleric-Ceyalya. In my mind, her 3rd-place position in the
party means she shouldn't be leading the party often, and hence, is
less likely to be targeted by missiles. Better shields will go to my
1st-and-2nd position Fighter/Clerics, as I find them.
  ---
*3: This toy could have come in handy on an early playthough. If you
don't have a Thief-or a sketchy Find Traps score-this could be a very
handy item indeed. At the end of the day, it replicates a 2nd level
Cleric spell once a day, or a Thief skill you should already be raising.
I wouldn't rely on this drop, as I found it only one time in seven runs
through this area. Besides, it doesn't disarm the traps, merely lets you
know where they are. Not quite enough, really.
  ---
*4: A simple +1 Dagger with a 'cute' story. Nothing remarkable about it
at all. By the way, despite my own diminuative stature, I hate
Halflings.
  ---
*5: This Cloak gives a +1 bonus to Armor Class and Saving Throws.. not
a bad item at this stage in the game.

Mill, Basement (AR2005)
o======================================================================o
8) In the cellar (AR2005) there are several goblins to kill and loot to
be had. Once the orgy of killing and looting is over, open the door at
(x=850, y=150) to find a little boy named Jermsy (x=850, y=130). As long
as the goblins outside are dead, you'll get experience for talking to
him. Unless of course, you find it hilarious that his family died. Then
you get nothing. And shame on you. Getting Jermsy to leave the closet
completes the quest.

***REWARD***
(For rescuing Jermsy)
EXP	2400

***ITEMS***
(x=520, y=220) Throwing Axe x6
(x=290, y=150) Sunstone Gem x3
(x=375, y=125) 15 gold

Mill, Tower (AR2006)
o======================================================================o
9) Now head up a ladder (x=250, y=400) to get to the mill tower, where
you'll find a few more goblins to kill. Once they're dead, you're done
with Kuldahar pass for now. Exit the mill and head to the east of the
map. The area transition to Kuldahar is well, anywhere along the
eastern edge of the map, but for the sake of argument, let's say it's
across that fancy stone bridge to the south (x=3830, y=1200).

Well, there's no way to get back to Easthaven until spring. I mean,
logically, the snow would melt and the avalanche wouldn't be blocking
our way, right? Makes sense. Unfortunately this is a video game, and in
video games it doesn't matter how many DAYS pass-the sun revolves around
quest progress. Still, pretend with me for a moment, would you? In the
mean time, until weather changes and the passes clear *winkwink*, we
might as well hang around Kuldahar. And since its survival is now our
survival, we might as well see about the troubles around here. I mean,
how much trouble could an isolated tundra village be involved in?

Kuldahar (AR2100)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK003}
		1) Nate-A Most Wondeful Name!
		2) Gerth's Equipment Shoppe
		3) Orrick's Tower
		4) Arriving at Arundel's
		5) Arundel's Ogre Asprin
		6) Mirek's Missing Heirloom
		7) Hjollder's House
		8) Garnet-Giving Gal
		9) Root Cellar Tavern
		10) Evening Shade Inn
		11) Conlan's House
		12) Oswald's Airship
		13) Temple of Ilmater

1) To the east is a kid (x=550, y=2000), who has an oddly sexy name.
Talk to Nate, this handsome, intriguing, Cadillac of children, and
he'll tell you about Arundel, and suggest that you should talk to him.
We'll explore the town as we go, and fortunately for Nate, Arundel's
House is nearby, so we'll be seeing him soon. First things first,
however, head into the building at (x=1000, y=1800)

Gerth's Equipment Shoppe (AR2113)
o======================================================================o
2) Inside is Gerth (x=370, y=170), who else? He runs the general store,
and will offer to buy 'historically significant' items from you. This
is, however, primarily a junk shop, where you can sell gems, jewelry,
and odd items that have no apparent function. He also sells some bardic
instruments, but as I have no bard, I have no interest in them. You may,
however, want to consider buying the Gem Bag, if you didn't buy one
earlier.

Bardic Horn of Valhalla
This horn summons 2-4 berserkers to fight for you. They're full of
weak-sauce, however, and are little more than distractions.
  ---
Lyre of Progression
Allows the bard to memorize two additional 2nd-level spells and one
extra 3rd-level spell. This is actually one of the better Bardic aids
in the game, as 2nd-and-3rd-level spells are pretty useful.

Orrick's Tower (AR2101)/(AR2102)
o======================================================================o
3) When you're done looking at the junk in Gerth's shop, head north
along the path to find a tower (x=350, y=800). Inside, on the first
level, you will find Weenog, a 'tame' Goblin who serves the master of
the tower. The Mage who owns this tower-Orrick-is through the door at
(x=380, y=300). Talk to Orrick (x=360, y=180) and ask about his work,
eventually accepting to keep an eye out for any Elven ruins you might
just happen to stumble across. What do you think, are the odds of that
ever happening?

He's not just a mindless quest-giver, however, he also sells stuff-Magey
stuff, in fact. He'll be your source of Mage Scrolls and other magical
trinkets throughout most of the game. Right now, however, I'm broke, so
I won't be buying anything, even though I'll tempt you by listing the
decent items he has for sale right now. He will change his inventory as
you advance through the game, however, so be sure to buy interesting
items when you've got the gold, lest he drop them from his inventory.
Don't worry, I'll warn you again before it happens, so you can run to
town and go shopping.

Finally, before leaving, there are a few trinkets we can grab now.
I already said I was broke, but this doesn't stop me from stealing from
Orrick, who has an Amulet of Metaspell Influence*1 and a Ring of Free
Action*2. My Fighter/Mage/Thief, Syrenil, has a 35% Pick Pockets score
right now, so this will take some save/loading to do.. but hey, magical
gear is worth a little bother.

Clasp of Bron's Cloak
This simple item grants its wearer a 5% resistance to Piercing,
Slashing, and Missile attacks-physical damage, in other words. 5% is not
a huge bonus-on a normal game, against most foes, it means you'll be
taking one less point of damage from attacks. Really, 5% equals one
point of damage reduced out of twenty. It's.. a petty little accessory,
but if you have the coin to spare, it.. well, it's decoration, really.
  ---
Girdle of Gond
A belt that adds +10 to Open Locks and +5 to Find/Remove Traps. It's a
fair toy for any Thief, but Syrenil will not really benefit it for long
(100% Find/Remove Traps is all I need, and when she hits 3rd level as a
Mage she'll have Knock). Save your money.
  ---
Robe of Enfusing
This robe gives a two point Armor Class bonus, +5% Magic Resistance,
and allows you to memorize one additional 1st-level Mage spell. Seems
good, and it's decent, but we'll find better. It stacks with other
protection items, and can be worn with Bracers of Defense.
  ---
Scarab of Goodwill
You can use this to cast Friends (normally a Mage spell) once per day,
but it can only be used by Clerics. At this point in the game, it'll
set you back about 7000 gold. For a 1st-level Mage spell. Once per day.
That can only be used by Clerics. On the other hand, you can just buy
the spell Friends for about 120 gold. Does the same thing, for a sliver
of the price.

*1: A simple little amulet that will give us one extra 2nd-level Mage
spell slot. It'll outgrow its usefulness eventually, but in the mean
time, an extra 2nd-level Mage spell won't hurt. Besides, it's not like
you PAID for it or anything.
  ---
*2: This ring prevents you from being paralyzed, either from a Hold
Person spell, Web spell, or from a critter's attack. We'll be fighting
foes who can paralyze you sooner than you think. I put this on my party
leader-the first into the fight is most likely to be affected by these
effects. Good news, we'll get another one of these rings shortly, which
can go on my second Fighter/Cleric, Amirule.

Arundel's House (AR2112)
o======================================================================o
4) Leave Orrick's Tower and head south, past Gerth's Equipment Shoppe,
to find Arundel's House at (x=1400, y=2150). Within this tree-abode
you'll find, Arundel (x=300, y=250), of course. Chat with him a bit to
learn about the town and its troubles. Apparently the 'Great Oak' in
town is a judgemental prick plant, and is allergic to some evil presence
in the mountains. As the tree gets sick, the warmth it provides fades;
this is a problem in an arctic environment.. although if the stupid tree
were to die, at least there would be plenty of fire wood on hand! Still,
I don't want to have to chop wood, do you? No? Good. That means we need
to search out this evil and stop it. Eventually Arundel will send you
off on a quest to investigate the Vale of Shadows, which is our next
major quest.. once we're done playing around in Kuldahar. Talk to
Arundel again and tell him about the ogre in the pass. He'll tell you
of an herbal remedy that may help him.

Before I run off to help Ghereg, however, pick pocket another Ring of
Free Action from Arundel. Now both of my leading characters have one.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Now, this might be a little inconvenient, but you can return to the
Ogre with the headache in Kuldahar Pass. We'll never really have an
excuse to return there for any other reason, and there's no good reason
to put this off (after all, we could use the levels), so head there at
your leisure. Tell Ghereg the recipe Arundel related to you for some
quest experience. Now we're done with Kuldahar Pass.. No really, this
time I mean it. Return to Kuldahar.

***REWARD***
(For giving Ghereg Arundel's headache cure)
EXP	1200
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Continue east, then north over a wooden bridge. There's a house to
the northwest (x=2000, y=1600) that contains absolutely nothing
interesting. Carry on to the east, past a statue of Archdruid Tolben,
and north past another house (x=3000, y=1800) which is entirely
uninteresting, to reach a snow-covered wooden bridge, near which you'll
be pestered by a 'Frightened Townsperson' named Mirek. He'll approach
and say he's being chased by Yetis*. Sure enough, two Yetis will appear
that need some death. They're more formidible than Goblins, but they
should still fail to pose any real challenge. After the Yetis are dead
talk to Mirek. He'll tell you about the Vale and ask you to recover a
family heirloom that his brother Silas was carrying.

*Yeti pelts are good stuff early on in the game. Refrain from selling
them until you have a full inventory, as prices go down as you dilute
the market. Selling off sixteen yeti pelts in one go will earn you more
money.

***HoF***
The Yetis here have been replaced with Tundra Yetis. Presumably a
slightly more powerful version? They die just as well.

Hjollder's House (AR2109)
o======================================================================o
7) Now, to loot some houses that are actually interesting.. well, kind
of. Over at (x=2750, y=1250) will be a house containing the barbarian
Hjollder (x=280, y=150)-instigator of the Heart of Winter expansion. Of
course, at this point in the game he does little more than to tell us
about his problems, and if we offer to help him out, he'll tell us how
much we suck (there's a level requirement for Heart of Winter, kids).
Before you go, however, there is a bit of looting you can do-be sure to
grab the Sling +1*1 from the closet near Hjollder. Just click on the
closet and wait-your party members should squeeze their way over to it
eventually. Honest.

***ITEMS***
(x=300, y=100) Sling +1, Bullets x20, 40 gold

*1: What can you say? Slings suck, but having a ranged option-any
ranged option-is a good idea. I put this on Eraithul. Shields work their
way down my party roster, ranged weapons can work their way up.

House (AR2016)
o======================================================================o
8) The house at (x=2200, y=900) has a Mummy's Tea on the bookshelf at
(x=300, y=100). In this house I also talked to the townsperson inside
about Kresselack, and ultimately obtained a Garnet Gem out of the
conversation. Score.

***ITEMS***
(x=300, y=100) Mummy's Tea

Root Cellar Tavern (AR2111)
o======================================================================o
9) After looting the houses of Kuldahar, head to the Root Cellar Tavern
(x=2030, y=850). There are a number of folks to chat with in here.
Whitcomb will get you liquor and Lysan will talk about the troubles of
the town. Amelia is the questy sort, however. Talk to Amelia about
getting a room. She'll tell you about the mysterious circumstances under
which the new owner of The Evening Shade, a halfling by the name of
Aldwin, came to own the establishment. We'll have to be sure to bring
that up when we head over to the inn, won't we? Also note that you
can talk to any random townsperson to learn about the troubles of
Kuldahar. People going missing, evil weather, that old rag. If you talk
to one with a Paladin, and ask about temples, you can champion the cause
of Ilmater for some experience.

***REWARD***
(For pushing Ilmater to the peasants)
EXP	1200

The Evening Shade (AR2114)/(AR2115)
o======================================================================o
10) Speaking of the Inn, head over to The Evening Shade Inn
(x=1200, y=500), where you cand find the new proprietor-Aldwin-at
(x=370, y=300). He'll be charging three times the average rate for
rooms, and will insist that his claim to the store is legitimate. Hmm..
There's searching to be done. Take the stairs at (x=50, y=150) and loot
around until you find Eidan's Legacy Ring (x=320, y=380). Once you have
the ring, you have some options. When you confront Aldwin, you can force
him to confess to the elders, or you can blackmail him into giving you a
free room whenever you want it. Since I dont have any healers, a free
noble room at my whim is a great alternative. Plus, you get the same
experience either way.

***ITEMS*** (AR2115)
(x=250, y=180) Studded Necklace with Zios Gems
(x=320, y=280) Eidan's Legacy Ring

***REWARD***
(For forcing Aldwin to confess)
EXP	3225

  ---or---

***REWARD***
(For blackmailing Aldwin)
EXP	3225
Misc	Free Noble Room

Conlan's House (AR2103)
o======================================================================o
11) It's time to head to the blacksmith's shop, which is at
(x=1480, y=400). Inside, Conlan-the blacksmith-will whine about his son,
and say some rather pessimistic things, overall. You can offer to find
his son, but this is a good distance off. In any case, sell any junk
you've been collecting from the Goblins. He's got some nice equipment
for sale, but almost all of it is well out of our budget.. but that
doesn't mean I won't discuss his goodies! Note that Conlan, unlike
Orrick, will NOT update his stock.. ever. This is a good thing, because
his better items are quite expensive. You can also try to nab Conlan's
Hammer from his chest, but if you don't have a good Open Locks score or
the Knock spell, you're probably out of luck.

Daisy
Comparable to The Black Bow-it's a Crossbow that gives +3 damage, +5
THAC0. There's one draw-back to Crossbows, however, that this weapon
doesn't address-their low rate of fire compared to bows. Some Crossbows
you'll find will give extra attacks per round, hence resolving this
issue, but this one will not.
  ---
Evil Spider Crusher of Doom
How can you argue with a weapon named 'Evil Spider Crusher of Doom'?
It sounds like a freakin' Diablo weapon! Anyways, it's a weapon that
gives a bonus versus spiders. Spiders shouldn't be too much trouble,
but at least this weapon has a base +2 enhancement bonus.
  ---
Faith Killer
A +2 Axe that gives +5% Magic Resistance and has a 5% chance to cast
Dispel Magic on targets you strike.. very similar to Bala's Axe from
Baldur's Gate 1. There are better solutions for enemy spell-casters,
however.
  ---
Fayr's Halberd
Another plain +3 weapon, if you're married to Halberds, it might be
worth a look, but you can find better.
  ---
Giant Killer
A +1 Sling that is +4 against Giants. There are a number of giants in
the game (Verbeegs, Ettins, Frost Giants, Fire Giants), but the best
way to deal with them is NOT by chucking rocks, even +4 rocks. Hitting
them with a highly enchanted melee weapon in the hand of a Grand Master
is a better idea.
  ---
Hellpick
Hellpick is a very expensive +3 Hammer, with absolutely nothing special
about it save an improved Speed Factor. Unfortunately, you can purchase
The Giving Star AND The Love of Black Bess for the same price.
  ---
Helm of the Trusted Defender
What can you say? This helmet rocks. It gives a +3 Armor Class bonus
and makes the wearer immune to Sleep and fatigue. The only problem?
It can only be worn by Gnomes and Halflings. I might have made
concessions for Heart of Fury by advocating an all-good party so I
could gather the Shimmering Sash, but I won't do so here. Yes, it is
a very nice helmet, but a multi-class Half-Elf has better class choices
than a Halfling or a Gnome.
  ---
Lonesome Road
A +3 two-handed Axe that boosts your Constitution by one point. It's a
decent weapon, really, but again, two-handed weapons aren't great for
front-line Fighters, as it deprives them of the use of a shield. Note
that Lonesome Road is the name of a Fallout: New Vegas DLC, made by
Obsidian (the revived, post-Interplay version of Black Isle). Just
showing off the anachronism of this guide.
  ---
Pig's Eye
This racist weapon is yet another item that is more powerful versus
a certain enemy-in this case, Orcs. Don't scoff, they won't all be as
weak as the one's we've already dispatched. On the other hand, it's a
very expensive weapon, and we'll find a comparable one-not a single
coin wasted.
  ---
Pikeman's End
A simple +3 two-handed sword. You'll find a highly enchanted two-handed
sword (or rather, a few of them) along the way, so you don't need to
spend money here.
  ---
Reliance
Reliance is a simple +4 Dagger. If you're using Daggers on a Mage or
Thief-they don't warrant you spending tens of thousands of gold on
their melee weapons. If it's for, say, a Fighter/Druid, then you may
have a case, but you'll find tons of daggers.
  ---
The Black Bow
This bow gives a +3 damage bonus and a +4 THAC0 bonus, making it a
pretty potent weapon. Still, you'll find plenty of potent Long Bows
throughout the game. This bow really needed to be a Short Bow, to even
warrant a serious look at it.
  ---
The Blade of Bael
Nothing special about it, it's just a very, very expensive +3 Bastard
Sword.
  ---
The Giving Star
Probably the best weapon being sold by Conlan, all things considered.
It's about half the price of many of the other weapons, has a +3
enhancement bonus, and has a 10% chance to cast Cure Light Wounds on
the wielder (that's you) and increasing your Strength by one.
Unfortunately it can't be used by Good characters, so I won't be buying
it.
  ---
The Love of Black Bess
How can you hate a +3 Mace? Sure, it has a 10% chance to cause foes
to lose 4 points of Luck-whatever the hell that means, but it's dirt
cheap compared to most of the other weapons! Really, it costs 1/3 as
much as The Giving Star. It's hard to argue against a +3 weapon for
7000~ gold.
  ---
The Lucky Scimitar
Magical Scimitars aren't very common in this game, and any Fighter/Druid
eagerly desires such weapons. A plus for this weapon is that it is dirt-
cheap, comparitively speaking, so it might be worth purchasing if you
decide not to go with Daggers. It's a +2 weapon that bestows the effects
of the Luck spell unto the wielder-which grants a +1 bonus to saves and
attack rolls. Not bad.
  ---
The Spear of White Ash
This Spear is a +3 weapon that has a 5% chance to deal 1d6 extra
damage. The +3 part is pretty nice, but the 1d6 damage.. eh.. What
ever. I'd rather have a shield on my front-line characters, which means
spears are out.
  ---
The Staff of Eron
A simple +3 Quarter Staff, at a premium price. Who would be using
Staves, anwyays? Mages? Their melee prowess doesn't warrant the price,
and Druids? They're better off with a Shield.
  ---
The Sword of Myrloch Vale
A +3 Long Sword that boosts your Lore. I can't really think of anything
good to say about a Lore boost, really, but a +3 weapon really speaks
for itself. Sadly, by the time you have tens of thosands of gold at
hand, you'll have already found (or will soon find) better.
  ---
Tombsweeper
Tombsweeper is a decent +3 blunt weapon that can be used by any of
our Fighter/Mage/Clerics. It suffers from too much competition, however.
Both The Love of Black Bess and The Giving Star are cheaper, and better.
  ---
Trollslayer
I try to stay away from weapons that gain most of their power against
only one specific foe (unless that weapon kills said foes outright, and
said enemies are half of the creatures in the game), but Trolls can be
very annoying, and this weapon is.. well.. an ideal way to deal with
them. Your only other options? Have potions of Fiery Burning, use
spells, or hopefully use a weapon that deals fire or acid damage, which
you would have needed to have found. If all else fails, keep this sword
in mind.

***ITEMS***
(x=350, y=100) 110 gold, Conlan's Hammer*1

*1: It's only a +1 War Hammer that improves the wielder's THAC0 and
damage when fighting iron golems. Still, it can hit ANY creature that
requires a magic weapon to keep, making it a useful tool at any level.
There are much better weapons out there, but Conlan's Hammer is still
worth holding onto.

Oswald's Airship (AR2108)
o======================================================================o
12) Our last stop is Oswald's Airship (x=3100, y=400), east of Conlan's
House. Oswald (x=400, y=150) is rather strange, but he'll sell you a
variety of potions. Of particular interest are Potions of Invisibility
and Potions of Giant Strength. If you have money burning a hole in your
inventory (which you don't) you'd do well to stock up on these. Most
importantly, Oswald has a good number of items to pick pocket. These
include two Oils of Fiery Burning, a Potion of Firebreath, a Necklace of
Missiles*1, and  a Ring of Protection +2*2.

*1: This unassuming piece of jewelry allows you to cast a weak (6d6)
Fireball-a great asset for a low-level party. You'll never really need
it, and it only has one charge left (so it doesn't sell for shit,
either).
  ---
*2: The Ring of Protection +2 is something that's going to be useful
the rest of the game, and while there might not be a placement issue to
worry about yet, it'll come in handy on the characters who can't wear
armor (mages). For now, just stick it on your party leader, where it can
remain until you find some magical armor to replace it with. Daisy-chain
it down the party as you find magical armor.

Temple of Ilmater (AR2107)
o======================================================================o
13) Now head south down near the statue of Archdruid Tolben, then east
to find a snow-covered bridge. Head north along the dried up river-bank
to find the Temple of Ilmater, (x=2800, y=700), outside of which is the
painfully boring Brother Ferg. Inside you'll find Ferg's brother..
Brother Gus. Talk to Sister Calliana (x=220, y=250), who is the only
remotely interesting character here.. and only because she can heal
you. Yay. Now that I've covered all of the places in this town..

We're done with Kuldahar for now! We've plundered what we could from
Kuldahar, recieved some quests, and gained access to free lodging. It's
time to travel to the Vale of Shadows, which can be accessed by exiting
from the eastern edge of the map (x=3830, y=1700).

Note: Sister Calliana used to have a more significant role in the game.
She would have mentioned a 'Revered Brother Poquelin', a name we will
hear again, but without any foreshadowing. She also would have talked
about the missing Revered Mother Egenia, another character that, as the
game stands now, appears with no prior mention. Most importantly, she
played a part in a quest much later in the game, where you tried to
aid a being known as the 'Voice of Durdel Anatha'.. the completion of
which would have scored you some silly gear and experience. This quest
(and these items) now only exist in the game's data files. Save from
cheating, there's no way you can get any of them. Although if you have
Infinity Explorer you can read the still extant conversation lines of
both the Voice of Durdel Anatha and Sister Calliana, and see the items
you could have obtained.

o======================================================================o
|								       |
|		          The Vale of Shadows		 	       |
|								       |
o======================================================================o
Finally, we're done with the prologue, and really, Kuldahar was just as
much of a tutorial as Easthaven was. This game starts out slow, but we
are finally looking at our first bit of real adventuring, with dungeons,
treasure, monsters and all that..

Vale of Shadows (AR3000)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK004}
		1) To the Northern Tomb
		2) Skeletons and Zombies
		3) Trap Cherry!
		4) To the Southern Tomb
		5) Ghouls and Ghasts
		6) Grabbing the Gate Key
		7) Yeti Chief Slaughter Fest
		8) The Yeti Cave
		9) Yet Another Tomb..
		10) Therik's Tomb
		11) Snatching the Sanctum Key
		12) Town Run!
		13) To Kresselack's Tomb

Tomb (AR3401)
o======================================================================o
1) Dark, windy, snowy, fun. Head directly east, ignoring a fork to the
south, and into the tomb at (x=1800, y=200). You'll encounter some
Lesser Shadows along the way, but fear not-they're no big deal. If they
hit you, they'll bestow 'Bad Luck' on you, which will go away on its
own after a few rounds. Inside the tomb you'll encounter some Skeletons
and Zombies, petty undead that should pose no threat. The Skeletons
will drop weapons-occassionally 'High Quality' versions, notable by
their healthy green hue. These weapons function the same as their normal
counterparts, but they have a +1 THAC0 bonus. If you find a High Quality
version of a weapon you like, be sure to equip it.

***HoF***
There's even more glory for my triple-classers in Heart of Fury mode,
as they possess the ultimate cheap tactic if ever there was a cheap
tactic. Even weak monsters in the Vale of Shadows are fairly tough in
Heart of Fury mode, but there's a trick we can-and should-employ. Cast
Invisibility on any Cleric, turn off party AI, then activate their
seldom-used 'Turn Undead' ability. The monsters in Heart of Fury have
been boosted, sure, but not enough to make them immune to smiting by a
high-level Cleric. It's an instant-death effect which, if you're a high
enough level (Clerics level 20+, or go home) should annihilate most
undead passively, quickly, and easily from here until... well, past
Dragon's Eye. I will merrily refer to this tactic as... Invisosmite!
Note that the invisibility part of it is optional-if you have a party
like mine, activating the 'Turn Undead' ability on all five triple-
classed characters and walking around is enough to turn my party into a
moving instrument of death. It does, however, work to make you
completely invulnerable while you smite-even if most undead won't be
able to withstand you for longer than a round anyways.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Loot the skeleton on the wall (x=780, y=650), then continue up the
stairs to the west. Here you'll find the first quasi-dangerous foe in
the game (save that Ogre, if you were under-leveled), a Carrion Crawler.
Its attacks can paralyze you, and since it attacks quickly and has some
Skeletons supporting it, a paralyzed character can be in some real
trouble. Engage it with the two characters protected by Rings of Free
Action. Once the Carrion Crawler is dead, mop up the Skeletons.

***ITEMS***
(x=780, y=650) Studded Leather Armor, Antidote (Cursed)*1,
	       Potion of Agility, Scroll of Luck

*1: You will occassionally come across potions that look different from
'normal' versions of that potion. If in the item description it says the
potion looks 'murky' or 'oddly colored' or some such, don't drink it.
It's either cursed, spoiled, or fake-either way, it's detrimental to
your health.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) To the east, a fork. First explore to the east to find a trap that
needs to be disarmed. Why does it need to be disarmed? To make this tomb
safe for the children! Now explore up the northern fork, where another
trap lurks at the entrance to the tunnel. Disarm it and explore north
until you find another skeleton that can be looted.

***ITEMS***
(x=940, y=130) Shortbow, Arrows x5, Scroll of Stinking Cloud*1

***TRAPS***
(x=990, y=450)
(x=620, y=380)

*1: Stinking Cloud is a fairly nice spell for debilitating groups of
enemies. Alas, most of your enemies are undead, and won't be affected by
it. In any case, with the Rings of Free Action I prefer Web, since I
won't be harmed by its effects.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Exit the tomb and backtrack to the west until you reach the fork
again. At it, head south until you encounter some Yeti. We killed them
just fine in Kuldahar, and there's no reason you should have more
trouble killing these ones than those. Continue south along a narrow
path until you reach another fork. Head east, the north. Smite some more
Lesser Shadows, then continue east to find another Tomb (x=1200, y=400).

Tomb (AR3101)
o======================================================================o
5) Immediately inside the tomb you'll be attacked by some Skeletons and
a Ghast. Ghasts and Ghouls are rather unfriendly due to their ability to
paralyze your party members. In the Gold Box D&D games, this set you up
for a coup'de'grace. Fortunately, you're not a one hit kill while
paralyzed in Icewind Dale, but you will be hit by every enemy attack.
Being paralyzed can allow the enemy to quickly tear a character to
ribbons, and is best avoided. If possible, characters with Rings of
Free Action should draw the attention of Ghouls and Ghasts to prevent
their paralyzation from working.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Grab the Gate Key from the golden statue to the north (x=350, y=450)
and cautiously explore the level. In the tunnel west of the golden
statue room are three traps waiting for you, and beyond them more undead
(including a Ghoul). To the east of the golden statue room there's a
trap that triggered at around (x=950, y=500) that I couldn't detect
even with Find Traps at 90%-so it's probably beyond the means of fresh
parties to detect. It summons some Lesser Shadows for you to kill,  so
it's probably worth tripping anyways. Turn the undead back into bits
of bone and ectoplasm, loot the sarcophagus in the northeastern corner
of the level, and head back out into the Vale.

***ITEMS***
(x=350, y=450) Gate Key, Scroll of Identify, Potion of Healing,
	       Scroll of Remove Fear
(x=260, y=330) Leather Armor +1, Scroll of Cure Light Wounds
(x=770, y=150) Potion of Healing, 21 gold, Scroll of Grease,
	       Scroll of Strength, ~Huge Long Bow*1, Potion of Genius
	       (3rd Play: Halberd of Sparks +1*2)
	       (4th Play: Flawless Two Handed Sword)
	       (7th Play: Finest Long Sword)

***TRAPS***
(x=300, y=720)
(x=230, y=630)
(x=170, y=540)
(x=950, y=500)

*1: A +3 damage bow. Unfortunately it lowers your Armor Class by 1, but
if you're a pure archer, who cares, right? Of course, if you have a
Composite Long Bow already, you've got +2 damage and +1 THAC0. This bow
isn't worth the trade off.
  ---
*2: It's a +1 Halberd with a 15% chance to deal an extra 1d10 electrical
damage.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Back-track to the last fork and explore to the west, following it as
it switch-backs to the east, until you finally reach yet another fork.
This time, explore to the north. Some Yetis are standing around waiting
for somebody to kill them. Oblige, then continue east to reach the
center of the map, a large platform dominated by a statue of a robed
figure. The prayers of statues are as effectual as the prayers of
people are-even more so, because they can hold the pose longer and
statues don't commit sins by liking things. It's the truth. We should
all endeavor to be more like statues, those blessed things (you can
start by giving me all your worldly possessions-those things just lead
to trouble). Anyways, more Yetis can be found around here, to the west.
You'll also find a ramp leading south, which you should take. Kill more
Yetis as you explore down the ramp, then to the east. In front of a
cave you'll find the Yeti Chieftan, a slightly tougher Yeti. Kill it and
loot it for two interesting items-Mirek's Family Heirloom, and a Long
Sword +1 (7th Play: I found a Morning Star +1*1, which is all the more
agreeable to my new party. You can also find a Short Bow +1 here, for
what it's worth.)

*1: Pretty simple weapon, it's got a +1 enhancement, which is better
than anything else I have. Like with shields and armor, I'll equip the
leader of my party with the finest gear I find, and daisy-chain down the
roster until everybody is uber.

Yeti Cave (AR3001)
o======================================================================o
8) Now, there's a cave nearby (x=2000, y=1300).. I know you want to get
back to town and turn in that amulet, but it can wait. There's really
no good reason to explore this cave now, since we'll be coming back here
later to resolve a quest.. but there's good loot inside we'd be well
served by picking up now. Wait. That IS a good reason. Anyways, inside
kill all the Yeti you find (there should be five of them) and loot the
crates to the north. This will get you some nice items, and enough Yeti
Pelts to fill an inventory. Lots of Clericy stuff here, eh?

***ITEMS***
(x=390, y=390) Mace +1*1, Chainmail, Potion of Agility
(x=370, y=410) Gold Necklace, 12 gold, Potion of Fire Resistance
(x=340, y=440) Fire Agate Gem, Turquiose Gem, Zircon Gem,
	       Moonstone Gem, Potion of Freedom
(x=310, y=420) Potion oif Healing x2, Potion of Genius,
	       Scroll of Glyph of Warding, Scroll of Prayer

*1: Another +1 blunt weapon, another Fighter/Mage/Cleric is happy.

Tomb (AR3201)
o======================================================================o
9) Return to the large platform with the praying figure and explore to
the north. There's another tomb up here, if you still have the inventory
space for some adventuring. Kill some Lesser Shadows along the way and
enter the tomb at (x=2600, y=400). Once inisde, you'll be accosted by a
number of Skeletons and a Ghoul. None of which should be able to phase
you.. at least, if the Ghoul is nice and attacks party members equiped
with a Ring of Free Action. Smite until you're the only things standing,
then loot. Once done, head north. There's a trap in the doorway that
needs to be disarmed, and another trap by the sarcophagus that I
couldn't detect. It summons a number of skeletons in the niches around
the sarcophagus, so again, there's no real problem in triggering it.
This is not the same trap as the trap ON the sarcophagus itself, mind
you.

***ITEMS***
(x=180, y=580) Scroll of Find Traps, Scroll of Chant
(x=780, y=460) Potion of Healing, Mummy's Tea
(x=850, y=320) 35 gold, Gold Ring, Bastard Sword, Scroll of Infravision,
	       Scroll of Protection from Evil, Potion of Infravision,
	       Chainmail +1*1

***TRAPS***
(x=600, y=550)
(x=850, y=320)

***ITEM FISHING***
Now, we'll have a chance to fish for another item shortly. This one
isn't terribly impressive, but it's not hard to get, either. In the
next Step we'll be traveling to a tomb, wherein we'll encounter a
Skeleton named Therik, who has random loot drops. I suggest you quick-
save before entering the tomb, kill and loot Therik, and if you get a
magical ring, keep it. If not, reload and try again.

*1: This armor is no better than Splint Mail, so you don't need to
bother wearing it. It sells well, however.

Tomb (AR3301)
o======================================================================o
10) Backtrack all the way to the fork that led us up to the center of
the level and explore the virgin path to the east. You'll shortly find
the entrance to yet another tomb (x=3400, y=1400). Once you enter you'll
be accosted by a skeleton warrior by the name of Therik. You can leave
peacefully (if you have the Gate Key, you'll have to give it up in order
to leave). Or you can kill him. Yeah.. let's kill him! He drops random
loot, as follows:

(1st Play: Ring of the Warrior*1)
(2nd Play: Phase Dagger*2)
(5th Play: Finest Halberd*3)
(7th Play: Potion of Action Transference*4)
(7-X Play: Flawless Two Handed Axe*5)

I suggest trying to get the Ring of the Warrior from him, as it's a
niftly little ring that increases the wearer's THAC0 by one. It's not
game-breaking, but since you can't stack Rings of Protection, you'll
probably be able to find a home for it for a long time.

*1: This is a tough one. All my fighters (the first five characters)
have the same strength modifier, and THAC0. But, Syrenil, my archer,
gets two-and-a-half attacks per round. Who will benefit more from this,
a character with one attack per round, or one with more?
  ---
*2: A cruddy little dagger with no enhancement bonus. It has a 15%
chance to phase enemies.. but the only thing really exceptional about
this weapon is that it actually makes Applebane seem not so bad.
  ---
*3: This nice little Halberd gives a +2 bonus to THAC0 and +10%
Slashing Resistance. I'd still stick with the Halberd of Sparks +1,
if you have it.
  ---
*4: One of several potions that will permanently alter your stats if you
drink it. Many of them are win-lose propositions-you gain +1 into one
attributes, but suffer a -1 penalty to another. This particularly vile
concoction causes you to gain a point of Charisma at the expense of one
point of Dexterity. It might as well be filled with goat piss.
  ---
*5: +2 THAC0, nothing else special about it. Who uses two-handed axes
anyways?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Beyond Therik you'll find a large number of skeletons across the
bridge. If you need a strategy, bottleneck them on the bridge with two
Fighters  and let the rest of your characters use ranged attacks to
decimate them. On the eastern side of the bridge you cand find a Ghoul
lurking around near some coffers to the east. Continue east (disarming
a trap along the way) and head down some stairs when you run out of
east. Along the stairs you'll get the pleasure of dispatching a variety
of undead, including Skeletons, a Ghast, and some Zombies. In the room
with the ring of sarcophagi at the bottom and the ajoining room to the
south we'll complete our undead collection by dispatching another Ghoul
and some Lesser Shades. Loot-be sure to grab the Sanctum Key*2-and
leave.

***ITEMS***
(x=1550, y=300) Long Sword, 9 gold, Helmet.
(x=1910, y=800) 14 gold, Dagger +1*1, Scroll of Color Spray,
		Potion of Strength
(x=1640, y=550) 6 gold, Scroll of Invisibility*2
(x=1800, y=1250) Sanctum Key*3, 26 gold, Broken Armor,
		 Scroll of Chill Touch, Potion of Insulation

***TRAPS***
(x=1800, y=350)
(x=1800, y=1250)

*1: A very minor upgrade to Aspel's Dagger.. but since it's magical,
it'll put you in the game against the many, many critters that require
magical weapons to harm.
  ---
*2: Sneaking might not be fool-proof (especially at our low level and
with my focus on thieving skills being directed to Find Traps), but
Invisibility is. We'll be using this spell for some of our more
complicated Item Fishing runs.
  ---
*3: The Sanctum Key opens the east (x=1600, y=1350) and west
(x=900, y=1150) doors in Kresselack's Tomb (AR3501).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) We've got one last tomb to raid-and it just so happens to be a
rather long one. This is a great time to head back to town, sell off
Yeti Pelts and other junk, buy more arrows, and generally resupply.
While in town I make sure to find Mirek, who's in front of the potter's
house (x=2090, y=1710). Give him the heirloom and he'll thank you. More
importantly, he'll reward you. Once you're ready return to the Vale
and backtrack to the tomb where we met Therik.

***REWARD***
(For returning Mirek's heirloom)
EXP	2400
Item	Sling +1*1

*1: Staying consistent with my statement on the earlier Sling +1, this
weapon goes to Nauzhir the Red.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) From Therik's Tomb head north and dispatch any (and many) Lesser
Shadows along the way. The path will terminate at a grand doorway
leading to the largest tomb (x=3300, y=400) of all-that of Kresselack.
I expect that even the most casual of gamers have well over 5,000
experience per character by now, and if you've been adjusting the
difficulty sliders, it's possible to have over 10,000. In any event,
we should all be at least level two with whatever characters we have.
You should also have the Sanctum Key, and at least two +1 melee weapons
if you've been following this guide. Anyways, when you're done staring
at the huge doorway in redundant awe of the wealth the living waste on
the dead (how many hungy kids could have been fed with the money wasted
on this tomb?), head inside.

|								       |
o======================================================================o
If you've been talking to townsfolk in Kuldahar, you've probably heard
of Kresselack the Black Wolf. A badass warlord who made life just a
little more unbearable in this winter wonderland, 'a whole legion of
soldiers, shamans, and priests under his banner.' Yeah, that guy. As we
all already know, the rich, powerful, and morally flawed (the thing that
tends to lead to one becoming rich and powerful) have the biggest houses
and best stuff in life. So too, in death. We should expect the tomb of
the Warlord Kresseleck, then, to be the largest, wealthiest, most well-
guarded tomb in the Vale of Shadows. And so it is. But that's good news
for us adventurers with sticky fingers.

Kresselack's Tomb (AR3501)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK005}

1) Open the door at the end of the eastern passage (x=1250, y=1500).
to find a large central room dominated by glowing green vats that look
entirely unhealthy. You'll be accosted by a number of Skeletons and
Tattered Skeletons within, and although it may be tempting to run in and
smite things, let them come to you, as a pair of Skeleton Archers and
Temple Guardians await further into the room, and there's no need to
engage everything at once, is there? I mean, it's not like you should
have any trouble dispatching these pathetic undead.. and really, why are
Skeleton guardians so prevelant? Sure, they've got no upkeep, but they
are woefully weak. Seriously, who is going to be put down by Skeletons?
A peasant? Sure, so peasants won't be raiding your forbidden tomb, but is
that really worth the effort? Is that who you are REALLY trying to keep
out? No! It's adventurers, who will chew up and spit out your hordes of
poorly placed weak Skeleton 'guardians'. Why not pool your money and get
ONE REALLY BADASS guardian? Or at least a door blocking the entrance
into your crypt. Sure, undead are creepy, but that's about it. Oh well.

***HoF***
A tomb full of undead, with no living monsters, and nary a Dispel Magic
or Detect Invisibility in sight.. you know what that means.. Invisosmite
the whole damn place! Anything that is immune to Invisosmite will be
much weaker without legions of skeletons around them.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Now, we have five paths before us-north, west, southwest, southeast,
and east. let's tackle the two southern paths first, since they're the
least bother. Search for traps before going down the southwestern
tunnel, as there's a nasty Flame Arrow trap waiting. Once it's been
neutralized, explore to the Southwest to find a room guarded by petty
undead. Smite them, and loot the (trapped) chest (x=310, y=1530).

***ITEMS***
(x=310, y=1530) 8 gold, Necklace, Scroll of Entangle

***TRAPS***
(x=800, y=1410)
(x=310, y=1530)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Repeat the process for the southeastern tunnel. You know the drill-
trap in the tunnel, undead (including a Ghoul) in the room beyond,
trapped treasure.. etc. I'm not being critical, if you simplify enough,
that's what all dungeons are. If only traps gave you experience in this
game, like in Baldur's Gate 2.. traps almost seem like a reward in that
game, but in this game (and in Baldur's Gate 1) they're just chores.

***ITEMS***
(x=1570, y=1940) 5 gold, Turquiose Gem.
(x=1600, y=2000) Long Sword +1, Potion of Healing x2, Mummy's Tea x2

***TRAPS***
(x=1570, y=1940)
(x=1400, y=1580)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) After looting the southern rooms head through the doors west of the
central room (x900, y=1150). Beyond, we'll find more baddies-Zombies
in the first room, Tattered Skeletons in the room beyond, and a Wight.
Icewind Dale really takes it easy on us with Wights, which aren't nearly
as bad as they should be (i.e., no level-drain. Unfortunately Baldur's
Gate 2 is nowhere near as nice..) Wights do, however, require magical
weapons to hit. At this point, my first two character (Ilnathias and
Amirule) have +1 weapons, so even though I can't touch them with missile
weapons, my front-liners can. And touch him they shall. Hard. With death
sauce. Loot the trapped sarcophagus to find the Priest's Key, which
we'll need soon enough.

***ITEMS***
(x=450, y=1030) Priest's Key*1, Potion of Healing,
		Potion of Infravision, Gauntlets of Weapon Skill*2

***TRAPS***
(x=450, y=1030)

*1: The Priest's Key opens the northern door (x=1400, y=930).
  ---
*2: Gauntlets of Weapon Skill are another +1 THAC0 item, which I also
give to Syrenil. Again, it's all about the extra attacks per round.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Now head through the eastern door (x=1600, y=1350), beyond which
several Ghouls with bad attitudes await. A scuffle ensues, and we all
get lunch detention. They're still full of weak-sauce, but Ghouls are
still more worthy as guardians. Ghouls can mess people up. If I had an
undead-ridden tomb, I'd have it filled with Ghouls (I can't afford
Ghasts after eight years of Bush.)

***ITEMS***
(x=1800, y=1370) Potion of Strength, Ring, 5 gold, Scroll of Armor,
		 Short Bow +1*1
(x=2000, y=1530) Holy Symbol of Myrkul*2, War Hammer, Splint Mail*3,
		 Scroll of Larloch's Minor Drain, Potion of Genius,
		 Scroll of Burning Hands*4

*1: This Short Bow +1 was a weapon I initially equiped on Syrenil-the
old 1st-playthrough Syrenil, before she became a Fighter/Mage/Thief.
She was at the time a Thief/Mage dual-class character, which I thought,
short-sightedly enough-was good enough. Little did I know that Short
Bows are quite rare in Icewind Dale, and laughably enough, this ended
being the first-and only-magical Short Bow I found. Moral of the story?
Short Bows suck!
  ---
*2: This opens the door at (x=1400, y=930).
  ---
*3: A free suit of Splint Mail? Score. I know it's pretty obvious-this
is my fifth-such suit of armor, and it replaces the Chain Mail on my
fifth Fighter/Mage/Cleric.. well, let's just say I've been surprised
before at what I need to tell people in these guides.
  ---
*4: The Scroll of Burning Hands will come in.. handy.. later when you're
fighting Trolls.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) After I'm done lootin' and pollutin', I enter the large door north of
the central room (x=1400, y=930). You'll be greeted by the Bone Dancer
Mytos. If you try to reason with Mytos (pick the following dialogue
option: "Mytos, I am trying to be reasonable here. I cannot in good
conscience leave until I have investigated this tomb fully. Can we come
to some understanding?") and you'll recieve a quest reward. Man, they're
really pushing this "good" thing. You can lie to yourself and pretend
you are trying to weasel out of a fight, if that's your preference.

Of course I said you can *try* to reason with Mytos. A fight here is
inevitable. Fortunately, it's also easy. Stay on top of Mytos, nobody
needs him casting spells. When he dies-again-he'll leave behind a Black
Opal Gem, and a War Hammer +1*1. (During my 7th playthrough, one of the
Temple Guardians also dropped a Battle Axe +1. Score.)

Note: Some of the stronger foes in here have a random chance of
dropping +1 weapons, typically Skeleton Archers (which can drop magical
arrows, bullets, or bolts, as well as Short Bows +1) and Temple
Guardians, which are fond of melee weapons (I've found +1 Morning Stars
and Battle Axes). The lesser foes may also drop high quality weapons, of
course.

***REWARD***
(For trying to reason with Mytos)
EXP	3225

*1: It's a magical blunt weapon, but it's weaker than the Morning
Star +1 and the Mace +1 I found earlier, but a magical weapon is a
magical weapon. Put it on a character specialized in Hammers.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) North of this room you'll find a group of Skeletons and a monster
called 'Myrkul's Sending'. There's a trap in front of the group, so let
them come to you. Myrkul's Sending is just a big shadow that can only be
hurt by magical weapons, which you should have plenty of by now. It'll
drop you a Ring of Shadows*1.

***TRAPS***
(x=1800, y=420)

*1: This is a nice ring, giving a 15% bonus to stealth and
non-detection. For now, I'll give it to my Fighter/Mage/Thief, Syrenil,
as she's more likely to sneak about. You know, because she's the only
character in my party who actually CAN sneak about.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) Bactrack to the room Mytos was in, and you'll notice that we have
two tunnels to explore-one to the northwest, and one to the northeast.
Explore to the northwest first, as the northeastern path will lead us
to our destination, and we can't have that. Soon the tunnel will turn
southwest, where it'll terminate in a small chamber guarded by two
Skeleton Archers. Be wary of the open sarcophagus that you can loot,
as there's a trap on it that I couldn't detect even with a 110% in Find
Traps, so I doubt it's meant to be found. Just take one party member up
to it so they all don't get hit by the Color Spray, then quickly smite
the Skeletons that appear with the rest of the party.

***ITEMS***
(x=820, y=700) Protection from Fire Scroll, Scroll of Haste*1,
	       Short Bow +1, 39 gold

***TRAPS***
(x=820, y=700)

*1: Haste is simply fantastic, and the fact that they give this scroll
to you so early is surely folly. From the time you can cast 3rd-level
Mage spells, you'll probably always have one prepared. If you like
winning, that is. Possibly the most essential of party buffs, it'll
transform our mediocore triple-classers into melee-machines, and you'll
be using it for the rest of the game. Just be wary of the fatigue period
that follows its use, if you use it too much and get too fatigued, the
game will force all your attack rolls to be 1-3. No joke. So be sure to
get some rest after a Haste or two.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) It's the northeast's turn to feel the bitter sting of our looting.
Disarm the trap on the way down the tunnel (x=2200, y=850) if you don't
want to make the Skeleton Archer's jobs any easier, then smite them.
Near where the Skeleton Archers were there is a secret door
(x=1900, y=1100), beyond which you'll find a Mummy. It can only be hit
by magical weapons, and if it hits you, chances are he'll inflict you
with a diease called 'Mummy Rot'. This disease is lethal over time, and
at this point in the game you probably only have two options as far as
curing it goes. You can use a Mummy's Tea, or go to the Temple of
Ilmater in town and pay for them to cast Cure Disease. Have your front-
liner with the best (lowest) Armor Class draw the Mummy's attention and
hope for the best. If you can nail it on the hardest difficulty (save
Heart of Fury mode, of course) this critter is worth a whopping 6000
experience-a huge boost at this point in the game (1000 experience per
character!) Equipping any Arrows +1 that Skeleton Archers occassionally
drop will help out immensely. Once the Mummy is dead, loot the chamber
it was guarding.

***ITEMS***
(x=1880, y=1040) Gold Ring, Gold Necklace, 14 gold,
		 Scroll of Blindness*1, Scroll of Aid
(x=1900, y=980) Mage Robe of Cold Resistance, Potion of Genius,
		Scroll of Knock*2, Mausoleum Key*3, Scroll of Resist
		Fear, ~Diseased Halberd +1*4
		(3rd Play: Giant Halberd*5)
	        (4th Play: Finest Light Crossbow*6)
		(7th Play: Finest Heavy Crossbow*7)

***TRAPS***
(x=2200, y=850)

*1: Blindness is a decent spell, if used against strong melee types,
it can all but take them out of the fight. Of course, it is in every way
inferior to Slow, and Web or Stinking Cloud are probably better 2nd-
level spells, but Blindness has no potential colateral damage.
  ---
*2: Knock is a wonderful spell, automatically opening any locked chest,
door, or whatever.. Provided it can be opened without a specific item,
that is. Since my party will have good thieves, I probably wont need
this spell, but it's a handy one to have regardless. Especially while
I wait to boost my Open Locks skill score to an acceptable level.
  ---
*3: This key opens the doors at (x=1300, y=700) and (x=850, y=1300) on
the Mausoleum level (AR3502), so do hang on to it.
  ---
*4: A +1 Halberd with a 10% chance to inflict a disease upon the
target. I'd still stick with the Halberd of Sparks +1, if I had to make
the choice.
  ---
*5: This wretched polearm deals a whopping 2d8 damage, but imposes a
-1 penalty to your THAC0 and a -2 penalty to Armor Class.
  ---
*6: A Light Cross Bow with a +4 THAC0 bonus.
  ---
*7: If you made your Fighter/Mage/Thief specialize in Cross Bows instead
of Bows, then this is an obvious improvement over whatever else you may
have, what with its +2 damage bonus and +4 THAC0 bonus.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) From the secret Mummy room, head east, then go up a tunnel to the
north. You'll have to deal with two Skeleton Archers at the the end,
and again these ones are defended by a trap (x=2300, y=950). The tunnel
will now turn south, and-again-more Skeleton Archers down the tunnel,
with a trap in front (x=2450, y=1100), and Temple Guardians behind them.
At the end of this tunnel, however, you'll find a door (x=2200, y=1320)
leading to the Mausoleum. Make sure you're in tip-top shape before
heading on, as it only gets rougher from here. Note that this is a great
time to head back to town if you're starting to get overencumbered.

***ITEM FISHING***
There's another wildly variable bit of random loot coming up, although
it's no simple matter to obtain it. In the Mausoleum there's a
sarcophagus that can be looted for some very nice items. My favorite?
The Reinforced Large Shield +1. To get it, however, you'll have to
endure an ambush by Tattered Skeletons, run through Skeleton Archers,
deal with a Skeleton Mage and a handful of Imbued Wights. Not as easy
as smacking around Therik. The way to do this? Save your game here,
before ever going down into the Mausoleum. Not a quick-save, either,
make a hard save. Then, go down into the Mausoleum, make a quick-save,
and send a character on a suicide mission to see what the sarcophagus
at (x=650, y=830) has inside of it. The item will, of course, be
unidentified, but if it's a Large Shield, you can bet it'll be the
Reinforced Large Shield +1 that we're looking for. If the item isn't a
Large Shield, reload your hard save from the level before, go back down,
quick-save, and check again. When it IS a Large Shield, reload your
quick-save (anybody checking the contents of the sarcophagus probably
won't survive the trip), and go through the level as normal. As long as
you confirm that the item in the sarcophagus is the item you want, it'll
remain so (remember, item drops are locked when you first enter the
area within which the level is dropped). If you have a Mage who can
cast Invisibility, then you've simplified matters quite a bit, as you
can just cast Invisibility, check the contents of the sarcophagus,
reload if it's not what you want, or return to your party and kick some
ass if it is. In any event, we'll use this trick again to farm for
gear.

***TRAPS***
(x=2300, y=950)
(x=2450, y=1100)

Kresselack's Tomb, Mausoleum (AR3502)
o======================================================================o
11) After going through the door (x=1800, y=1200) (Where? Oh!) in front
of you, you'll enter a large, pillared room. When you step anywhere near
the first pair of pillars a trap will trigger and you'll be ambushed by
a number of Tattered Skeletons and Skeleton Archers. I let a character
with stealth sneak into the room, trigger the Tattered Skeletons and
lure them into the first room where I can slay them without provoking
the archers. Don't sweat the location of this trap too much-it's not
detectable, and it's always going to go off. It's another one of THOSE.

***HoF***
Invisosmite!
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) After you kill all the skeletons that appear in the pillared room,
make sure you're in good shape and head forward to engage the archers.
There's a titanic battle ahead that can be rough even for a well built
party. My options here are pretty limited-I don't have enough ranged
power to go shot-for-shot against a host of Skeleton Archers, and I
don't have any great area-of-effect damaging spells to use against them.
My solution? Lead with my best Armor Class and let them get a cheap shot
off, then retreat, luring them with me. Once they're off the stairs I
attack and smite them in melee. When the skeletons on top of the stairs
are dead (there are some melee-types behind the archers that should be
lured down and destroyed as well) I sneak forward with Syrenil. As soon
as I get the Skeletal Mage in sight, I concentrate my fire on him.
Syrenil should be able to shoot him down by herself. Once he's dead it's
time to mop up the rest of the critters in this level, which include
Imbued Wights. They require magical weapons to hit and will start out
fights with a Magic Missile spell-which is absolutely brutal in Heart
of Fury Mode-and somewhat annoying at these humble levels even out of
Heart of Fury mode. A humble Shield spell cast by any of my front-
liners, will, however, block the effect. To the west are some Temple
Guardians, but they require no special consideration. After all the
undead are redead, loot around the place, including the open
sarcophagus. The Skeletal Mage itself will leave behind a gem and
Bracers of Defense AC 8*1.

***HoF***
The Invisosmite strikes back!

Note from Lee:
Dispatching the various archers and other skeletons is relatively easy
if you follow the instructions and lure them to you 1-2 at a time. Then,
use the center pillar to block yourself from sight of the Mage, and
continue to draw the other skeletons down to the party until you don't
see any more of them; then move on to the Mage.

I position my party just below the bottom edge of the staircase
(grouped to the south), and cast area-effect spells as far into the
room as I can (should be a bit behind the center pillar). This should
trigger the Mage, who will cast a Stinking Cloud at the party - if your
timing is right, you can move out of the effect area and go up the
northern section of stairs (gathering to the north and then going up
south should also work). Magic Missile the Mage, then move back to
tackle the first of the Tattered Skeletons. Entangle holds off the
Imbued Wights while I deal with the last of the Skeletons (Web will
not - they're somehow immune). The area effect spells should keep the
Mage occupied, and he's cake once his guards are gone.

***ITEMS***
(x=650, y=830) ~Wand of Sleep, Scroll of Agannazar's Scorcher*2,
	       Potion of Insight, ~Massive War Hammer*3, Mummy's Tea x3,
	       Scroll of Cure Moderate Wounds
	       (2nd Play: Wand of Magic Missiles, Static Dagger +1*4)
	       (3rd Play: Reinforced Large Shield +1*5)
	       (7th Play: Dazer*6)

*1: Bracers of Defense are useful tools for characters who cannot wear
armor, namely Mages. When I dual-class, they'll most likely be stuck
with Bracers like these.. but hopefully a little more potent. For now,
these can just go on Syrenil, but I'd prefer to keep the Gauntlets of
Weapon Skill on, instead. She attacks far more frequently than she is
attacked.
  ---
*2: Just like Burning Hands, Agannazar's Scorcher is good for taking
down Trolls. You can also toast a couple of them in a line, if you
position yourself well.
  ---
*3: +2 damage in exchange for -2 THAC0? No thanks. It'll sell well
though.
  ---
*4: A +1 Dagger with a 50% chance to deal 1d3 electrical damage.
  ---
*5: Easily the best item you can find at this point in the game, it
gives a +2 bonus to Armor Class, an extra +1 bonus versus Missile
Weapons, and +10% Slashing Resistance. You could easily find yourself
carrying this shield around for a long, long time. Unfortunately, it's
not a guaranteed drop, nor is it terribly easy to save/load. It is
possible, however, and if you have a single power-gamey bone in your
body, you'll make the effort.
  ---
*6: A +1 Club with a 5% chance to stun targets. Not bad, but not great,
either. It could go on a needy Fighter/Mage/Cleric.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) Once again we stand amidst the smashed and broken bodies of our
foes. Once again, we've got five paths we can take, at least in theory.
To continue on, we'll need to get the doors to the west open. The lever
(x=930, y=900) on the pillar near the elevated triangular area certainly
has a role to play. Alas, it's locked (a locked lever?) so we'll have
to go key hunting. First, let's rule out some of our options. To the
north and south you'll find more chambers (one in each direction), each
beyond a pair of green, glowing vats (green, creepy, glowing vats are an
essential furnishing for all undead.) To the southwest you'll find
Tattered Skeletons and another Imbued Wight. To the north you'll find an
unguarded sarcophagus, warded by a pair of traps.

***ITEMS***

*2: The Wand of Armory can be used to cast Shield or Ghost Armor on the
user. It has a finite number of charges (twenty-four charges, as it
were), and you should never really need to cast either spell. Sells
good, though.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
14) Now we only have TWO paths to search. Go through the door to the
northeast (x=1300, y=700) first. Beyond the door you'll find more
Skeletons-what else? Slaughter them like the trash mobs they are, then
loot the coffers for some goodies. When you're done, open the door at
(x=1900, y=500) smite some Zombies, and loot the shelf at
(x=1450, y=450), upon which rests a Plain Key*1. We'll need this key
to fully explore the area southeast of the large, central room.

***ITEMS***
(x=1450, y=450) Plain Key*1, Scroll of Slow Poison

*1: The Plain Key opens the door at (x=1000, y=1800).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
15) Three down, one to go. Head through the door at (x=850, y=1300) and
smash some Skeletons beyond. Ignore the gate (x=1000, y=1800) to the
south and round up Skeletons around the corner, then loot the coffers.
Once you're done smiting and looting (pretend you're a crusader!) Open
the gate we ignored earlier, but be wary, as three traps await just
beyond the gate. Disarm the traps (carefully) and destroy some Temple
Guardians beyond. Explore to the northwest, smite some Ghasts, and
loot the skeleton at (x=580, y=1730), where you can score a Black Wolf
Talisman*1, a great item that somebody will be wearing for the rest of
the game. Seriously. It's good stuff. Anyways, head to the central
chamber and activate the lever (x=930, y=900), then head to the next
level (x=250, y=600).

***ITEMS***
(x=1080, y=1450) 40 gold
(x=1070, y=1400) Sling +1
(x=1200, y=1600) Skull
(x=1350, y=1550) 2 gold
(x=1350, y=1500) Fire Agate Gem
(x=1500, y=1520) 6 gold
(x=1500, y=1480) 4 gold
(x=1750, y=1570) Blood Stone Amulet
(x=1750, y=1530) Bracers
(x=580, y=1730) Black Wolf Talisman*1, Scroll of Hold Person

***TRAPS***
(x=1000, y=1900)
(x=960, y=1900)
(x=940, y=1900)

*1: As a quest item, it allows you to pull the lever at (x=930, y=900)
and continue to Kresselack's Court (AR3503). As an item, it gives a
+1 bonus to Armor Class, +10 Hit Points, +10% Cold Resistance, and
+1 to Save vs. Breath. It stacks with any and all other magical gear.
I can't think of a better amulet to wear in the entire game.

Kresselack's Tomb, Court (AR3503)
o======================================================================o
16) Another big fight in here, involving Spectral Guards, Tattered
Skeletons, Temple Guardians, and Skeletons. Fortunately there are no
spell casters. Stay put and let the baddies come to you. You've got
enough on your plate at the entrance, and the situation will only get
worse if you provoke the entire level. Once the dust settles, be sure to
loot around in case any of the bigger baddies dropped a magical weapon
and/or assorted high quality weapons, which aren't very special anymore.
Once all the initial foes are dead, I creep around the rest of this room
with my archers and shoot the odd undead down.

***HoF***
Return of the Invisosmite!
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
17) The game is throwing us a curve ball here-we just smote large group
of foes-but this time we only have THREE places to explore! Sneaky.
Since the western path leads to our objective, you should already be
able to guess that it's the last place we'll be exploring. Head north
first and you'll find a room occupied by Shadows and a Mummy (again,
worth a hefty bit of experience if you take them out in harder
difficulties). Try to lure the enemies out of the room to you, as there
are traps in the doorway. Once you're done killing, loot the sarcophagi.

***ITEMS***
(x=2100, y=420) 32 gold, Scroll of Ghoul Touch, Scroll of Hold Person,
		Scroll of Silence 15' Radius
(x=2500, y=350) Bloodstone Gem x2, 23 gold, Scroll of Shocking Grasp,
		Potion of Strength, Potion of Healing
(x=2700, y=550) Ancient Armor, Potion of Strength, Helmet,
		Mummy's Tea x2, Scroll of Cure Moderate Wounds

***TRAPS***
(x=2300, y=650)
(x=2300, y=630)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
18) Now head to the southern room where you'll encounter a Mummy, a pair
of Imbued Wights, and a pair of 'Chosen Zombies', all of which require
magical weapons to harm (there are also some normal Zombies here
serving as filler. And, as usual, there are some traps in the doorway,
so if you rush on in, you're probably not coming back out. Lure the
enemies out piecemeal and deal with them seperately. Save your 'L'
button the strain.

***ITEMS***
(x=1250, y=1670) Scroll of Color Spray, Scroll of Magic Missile*1,
		 Potion of Healing x2, Scroll of Cure Light Wounds
(x=1450, y=1850) Skydrop Gem, Jasper Gem, Andar Gem, 19 gold,
		 Scroll of Shield, Potion of Stone Form.
(x=1760, y=1920) Composite Long Bow, 25 gold, Scroll of Chant

***TRAPS***
(x=1600, y=1650)
(x=1600, y=1680)

*1: Magic Missile is a wonderful little spell. Long after the other 1st
level spells have faded into obscurity, Magic Missile lives on. It's
a handy little spell that-once a Mage reaches 9th level, can inflict
10-25 damage on a single foe. It's a little late in the game to recieve
such a basic spell, but better late than never.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
19) All that remains is to explore to the west of the intial chamber.
There you will find plenty of Spectral Knights, Skeleton Archers, and a
Skeletal Mage. Again, life is easier if you lure some of them out and
deal with them piecemeal. Why so much hostility? Well, they said you
look like dorks. There.. now we're justified. The Skeletal Mage has
Bracers of Defense AC 8 and a gem. When the fighting is over, all that's
left is to enter the final door (x=900, y=700).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
20) Beyond you'll find Kresselack himself. All his minions are dead,
why not him? Enjoy the fantastic voice acting of the late Tony Jay
(aka, the Lieutenant from Fallout, the Elder God from the Legacy of
Kain series, and many, many other roles.) This conversation is an
excerise in the illusion of choice-there isn't any. It only ends one
way. Kresselack, due to his misguided attempts at immortality, is bound
to his crypt for all eternity. Unfortunately, a Priestess of Auril has
been lurking around, and would like nothing more than to desecrate
Kresselack's tomb and Kresselack himself says it best "I do not wish
to spend eternity in a cold, lightless hell". Kill the Priestess of
Auril for him and he'll answer your questions about the evil in
Kuldahar. Why would a ghost care where it spent its after life? What,
is he going to trip and stub his toe? He's incorporeal! Why should
warmth matter? Maybe he likes to read? Whatever the case, that's what
we must do.

"I ravaged the lands and brought all who opposed me under my rule. I
built a kingdom upon the corpses of my enemies, and I reveled in the
glories of war." ..oh Tony Jay, you were too awesome for this world.
Except that you weren't because you were here, but you were still pretty
awesome.

Yeti Cave  (AR3001)
o======================================================================o
21) Remember that cave near the Yeti Chieftan we killed a while ago?
The one with all the cool Cleric stuff? Sure you do. That's where we'll
find our bad Priestess of Auril. Head back out into the Vale of Shadows
and enter the Yeti Cave (x=2000, y=1300). On the ridge to the north,
where the crates lie, is where we'll find our Priestess, who happens to
be none other than Lysan the tavern wench. Talk to her, and call her
out-nothing she says should make you believe there will be a peaceful
resolution to this (even if we weren't sent here to kill her anyways).
Listen to her hair-brained schemes, and a fight ensues thereafter. She
will summon some Yetis to help her-but we've long since been too strong
for them to be more than a bother-and that's exactly what they are.
Lysan is the real threat. As a Cleric, her first ambition is to hit us
with a Hold Person spell, which will make those Yetis seem much more
formidable. Fortunately, she should target your front-liners to no
effect (those Rings of Free Action save the day again!) Just make sure
your other party members aren't too close and try to shoot Lysan to
interrupt her spells. If you hit her with your own Hold Person or
Silence 15' Radius (five Fighter/Mage/Clerics means I can chuck five of
them at her in one round) you'll significantly reduce the threat she
poses. She's not too tough, and once she's dead, the Yetis are child's
play. Once she dies, a Lesser Shadow will show up and thank you for
freeing it from Lysan's curse. Hurray! But since it didn't give us any
experience, I hate it forever. Anyways, loot Lysan for a Morning
Star +1.. by now you should be able to find a home for it yourself.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
22) Head back to Kresselack and inform him about your altercation with
the Priestess of Lysan. In return the evil spectral warlord will.. fail
to uphold his end of the bargain. Sucker! What did you expect? He's not
a nice fellow (and you did kill all his buddies.) It's all good though,
as we'll recieve the largest experience reward of the game so far for
helping him (big, big temptation to turn up the difficulty here.) Plus
he'll allow us to raid his sarcophagus, which will get us several worthy
items-like our first suit of Plate Mail Armor.

***REWARD***
(For telling Kresselack that you dealt with Lysan)
EXP	13000
Misc	You get to raid Kresselack's sarcophagus

***ITEMS***
(x=350, y=510) 53 gold, Potion of Healing, ~Flaming Short Sword +1*1,
	       Kresselack's Sword*2, Plate Mail Armor*3, Helmet*3
	       (3rd Play: Fine Long Sword +1*4)
               (4th Play: Giant Two-Handed Sword*5)
	       (7th Play: Phasing Bastard Sword +1*6)

*1: The Flaming Short Sword is a mediocore weapon, but since it deals
fire damage, you should keep it handy. Trolls are annoying, and it's
much easier to switch to a flaming weapon (or one that deals acid
damage) than it is to rely on your spells to put one down.
  ---
*2: A simple +1 Two-Handed Sword.
  ---
*3: A normal suit of Plate Mail Armor and a normal Helmet,
statistically, but blackened, awesome armor aesthetically. Oh yeah, I
dig it. Why am I so excited about heavy armor that won't allow me to
cast any Mage spells? Well.. with the multi-class party, most of my
Mages simply won't have any spells to cast on the first playthrough.
That being the case, their inability to cast Mage spells in heavy armor
seems rather moot. As I said earlier, it'll take several playthroughs to
collect all the gear we need to be a Heart of Fury uber party.. and
that includes spells. Fortunately, as we play we'll collect great
armor like Elven Chainmail of the Hand +3 and Watcher's Robes.
  ---
*4: A +1 Long Sword that has an additional +1 bonus to THAC0.
  ---
*5: This Two Handed Sword deals +4 damage, but has a -1 THAC0 penalty.
The damage/THAC0 trade-off isn't that bad, really, but since it's not
magical, I don't even consider it. We'll be needing enchanted arms to
hurt plenty of critters.
  ---
*6: A +1 Bastard Sword that has a 15% chance of phasing an enemy. What
good that does, I have no idea.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
23) Once that's over with, head back to Kuldahar. If you talk to
whitcomb at the Root Cellar Inn about Lysan, you can convince him to
give you her belongings. These include a Scroll of Cure Serious Wounds,
a Scroll of Cure Critical Wounds, a Protection from Fire Scroll, and
the Mantle of the Coming Storm*1. Now go report to Arundel.

*1: This cloak gives a +1 bonus to Armor Class, as well as a +1 bonus on
saves versus paralyzation, and +30% resistance to fire and cold.
Unfortunately, it will not work with other magical protection. I give
this to my Kaelinalia, as she doesn't have a Ring of Free Action, and
she's normally third in line for defensive items like this, so it'll
be a while before she has to pass it on due to wearing some magical
armor.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
24) After Arundel hears about the Vale and Kresselack, he'll send you on
a new errand-this time to find the Heartstone Gem. Since this seems to
be a sure-fire way to find where the evil is, it makes one wonder why he
didn't just send you after the Heartstone Gem in the first place. But..
I guess the Vale of Shadows DID need to be dealt with. In any case, more
experience for everybody, and a new quest to tackle. All of my
characters are level five or higher (everybody should have at least
10000 experience), and magical weapons abound, so we should feel pretty
good about moving on to the next area. And if you don't, you really
don't have many options. Although there is some merit in exporting all
your characters, starting a new game, and quickly playing through
things again (the more Black Wolf Talimans we have, the better!) If
you're not incompetent or a pussy, it's time to head on to the Temple of
the Forgotten God..

***REWARD***
(For reporting Arundel about the Vale of Shadows)
EXP	10350
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
25) But first, it's time to go shopping! Wee! Sell off all the junk
you found in Kresselacks Tomb. For me, this means pretty much every
potion that's not a Potion of Healing or a Mummy's Tea, all gems and
jewelry, all Clerical Scrolls, all high quality weapons, and all Yeti
Pelts. Also sell off all those junk keys you found. I found less than
350 gold during my exploration of Kresselack's Tomb, but made over 7000
gold by selling off all the non-magical junk I picked up. If you sell
off magical arms and armor you found, you stand to make quite a bit
more. Personally, I prefer to save them so I can sell them in bulk
later. It's not a bad idea to stash them all in a container in the
Evening Shade Inn, our adventuring hub. This newfound money (just over
10,000 gold in total) allows me to buy The Love of Black Bess from
Conlan, should I so desire. Of course, I can always buy some of the
spells or magical items from Orrick too, and considering that he
rotates his inventory, his items take priority. When you're ready, exit
Kuldahar from any edge and travel to the Temple of the Forgotten God.

o======================================================================o

o======================================================================o
Well, the Vale of Shadows was a bust, Kresselack doesn't know anything,
and the troubles there were caused by Lysan, an evil Priestess of Auril.
Still, a lesser evil was destroyed, and it WAS a threat to Kuldahar-just
not the threat we're looking for, apparently. Somebody really hates this
place. So, Arundel sent us off on another mission, to recover the
Heartstone Gem, which will let him divine the true source of Kuldahar's
woes. Apparently he realized (eventually) that wandering around the
tundra aimlessly wasn't going to yield results. So, off to the Temple
of the Forgotten God we go! Be wary, however, there's a bit of a
difficulty spike here. Thankfully, this area is relatively short.

Temple of the Forgotten God, Exterior (AR3600)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK006}
		1) Giving Red-Toe a Black Eye
		2) Temple of the Chore Foes
		3) Long Bow Fishing
		4) Looting the Library
		5) The Eastern Areas
		6) Looting Level 2
		7) Final Resistance
		8) The Heiststone Gem
		9) To Dragon's Eye!

1) Head north and you'll encounter a Verbeeg-a lesser type of Giant-
who will tell you that something is amiss ahead. Apparently the priests
here are under attack by 'bad priests.. with hurtful magic.' Any chance
that the enemy of our enemy is our friend is true? No, of course not,
it never is. Anyways, you can pick a fight with this Verbeeg if you
want.. You know, for his shield. Not that anybody would be cheap enough
to have not bought a Large Shield for all their shield-bearing
characters by now, of course not.. Heh..

***ITEM FISHING***
You've done a few of these now, so I assume you understand how this
works. Save now, enter the Temple of the Forgotten God, Level 1, sneak
or fight your way over to a chest to the west of where you enter to find
a chest (x=480, y=1700). The item you're looking for here is the
Longbow +2: Defender. It's certainly the best weapon we've had a chance
to get our hands on so far. There's technically another item we could
try to get at (x=500, y=1400), but the odds of finding both this bow and
something good in the other chest is slim. The bow is the real catch, I
suggest just accepting whatever the other chest drops. This process is
complicated somewhat by the fact that there's another, weaker Long Bow
we can find from this chest-the Long Bow +1: Protector. It's pretty
much the same thing.. but +1. Still, my Fighter/Mage/Thief can sneak
past the baddies, check the contents, cast Identify on the bow to make
sure it's the right one, and either reload your quick-save at the
entrance and proceed back normally, or sneak back.. and proceed
normally.

Temple of the Forgotten God, Level 1 (AR3601)
o======================================================================o
2) Upon entering you'll be accosted by an acolyte, who blames you for a
crime you weren't party to. No matter what you say, the paranoid priest
attacks. He's initially unaided, but some Verbeeg will come to his aid
shortly, so be sure to put the Acolyte down quickly. This area is
populated by two new types of enemies, Verbeeg and Acolytes. Verbeeg are
tough foes, and they do more damage than any creature you've fought so
far. The fact that they all drop Halberds and Large Shields and give a
pathetic 420 experience makes them even more laborious to defeat.
Acolytes can only make matters worse by casting spells to incapacitate
or immobilize your party members. They also can cast Static Charge,
which can do some wretched electrical damage, which our triple-classed
characters simply can't afford to sustain. So, the reasons why this
place sucks; 1) the enemies are relatively strong, 2) they drop crap
loot, and 3) they're not worth much experience. This place will be a
chore, but at least it'll be over soon.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Once all the baddies in the first room (we can affectionately call it
the 'fountain' room) head north to where the Acolyte was, then head
west. Follow the tunnel south, until you find another tunnel parallel
to the last one. You'll probably have to smite some Verbeeg along the
way-damned vermin that they are. All along the western side of this
hallway you'll find rooms worth looting. The southern room, in
particular, has a chest that can yield the Long Bow +2: Defender*1,
a superior weapon at this point of the game. In the room north of it
you can also find items of varying quality. The northern-most of the
three western rooms contains two cabinets that can be looted, and..well,
not every container can give us uber gear, right?

(x=250, y=1200) Potion of Healing

*1: +2 damage, +3 THAC0, +2 Armor Class, +2 Save vs. Spells.. Yeah,
this is a pretty sweet bow. It's good enough that I'm not even
considering shelling out gold for the Black Bow anymore. I put this
on my Fighter/Mage/Thief, Syrenil.. because she's the only one who can
use it.
  ---
*2: This Long Bow grants a +1 bonus to damage, +2 THAC0, and a +1 bonus
to Armor Class. It decent, but it's only a pale imitation of the Long
Bow +2: Defender.
  ---
*3: This can go on any character not wearing magical armor.. which
should be anybody (it's not compatible with the Mantle of the Coming
Storm, however.)
  ---
*4: A crappy amulet that allows the wearer to cast Emotion Control:
Courage once per day. It's used to negate fear, as infrequent of an
effect as that is in this game.
  ---
*5: Boots of Moander give the wearer immunity to Entangle. If you
already have Rings of Free Action, you're already immune, and if not..
this is one of the few places where you'll actually find foes who use
Entangle.
  ---
*6: This ring gives the wearer 10% Missile Resistance.
  ---
*7: Everybody likes summoning items, right? Sure you do. This chess
piece summons a 'warrior-like ally to attack enemies'. You don't get to
control this ally, however, so its use is pretty limited.
  ---
*8: Simple boots that allow the user to cast Blur once per day. These
will become patently useless when we get the Shimmering Sash, shortly.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Now explore the large room at the northern end of this tunnel, within
which you can find two Acolytes and another Verbeeg. Pay special
attention to the Acolytes, as their spells can be more dangerous than
the Verbeeg's melee.

Note from Lee:
I position the party in the northern-most of the three side rooms, with
the weaker characters against the back wall and stronger, melee-types
in front. Then I send one character up to trigger the encounter in the
larger room, and draw the combatants back to me. The reason for this is
that once the engagement begins, some enemies will come up the hallway
from the south; by fortifying myself in this room I can take on whatever
they throw at me and not have to worry about protecting my rear or my
flanks.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Return to the fountain room and explore to the east this time. Follow
the tunnel south, and when you reach a room, loot the barrels in the
corner for some junk. Head north through two rooms, slay another Acolyte
and Verbeeg, and head down the stairs to the west-mind the trap on one
of the steps (x=1200, y=360). You'll find the entrance to the next level
at (x=800, y=400).

***ITEMS***

***ITEM FISHING***
The next area also has two chests that drop random loot, although
nothing quite as good as the Long Bow +2: Defender. There's also no
way to avoid fighting while doing it, although my Syrenil was more than
strong enough to shoot down an Acolyte on her own (a Verbeeg is another
matter..) If you bother, loot the northern chest (x=1400, y=700) first,
then loot the southern chest (x=1900, y=1580). You know the drill.

Temple of the Forgotten God, Level 2 (AR3602)
o======================================================================o
6) From where you arrive head north and smite a Verbeeg. To the east
are some stairs. For our part, we're going to employ the good old creep-
and-snipe, as there are many Acolytes ahead just waiting to make your
life hard. While they're easy to shoot down, you also risk stepping on
traps and drawing more attention if you rush up to them. Shoot down one
Acolyte just beyond the stairs, then continue forward until you reach
a large chamber. Shortly into this chamber you'll find a trap at
(x=1150, y=1300). Disarm it, shoot down an Acolyte to the east, then
loot the rooms to the north and south (the southern room has a trap
running across it (x=1400, y=1600). When you're done looting, continue
to the east to find two more rooms (north and south) to loot. The
northern room is guarded by an Acolyte, and the southern by a Verbeeg.
Kill them both and loot the chests in the rooms they were guarding for
some random-and possibly quite decent-goodies. Head eastward some
more, disarm another trap (x=2000, y=1050). One more fight remains.

*1: Talk about an improvement. Charged weapons are great. This one has
a 50% chance to do 1d3 electrical damage, and more importantly, a 15%
chance to stun when it hits. Also, it's a +2 weapon. You never know when
you'll run into a monster that needs +2 or better weapons to hit.. It's
sooner than you'd think..
  ---
*2: A humble +2 Halberd with a unique name.
  ---
*3: Another fire-damage dealing weapon, another reminder to hold on to
these weapons. Otherwise it's a +1 Bastard Sword with a 25% chance to
deal 2d3 fire damage, superb against Trolls.
  ---
*4: This Bastard Sword has a +2 enhancement bonus and has a 2% chance
to turn targets into solid ice-it's like petrification, but instead of
stone.. yeah, you get it. Also, all the damage it deals is cold damage-
no physical. It's an interesting weapon, to say the least, but most
undead are immune to cold damage, and as you've seen, there are tons of
undead in the game.
  ---
*5: +1 Studded Leather Armor that gives you a +15% bonus to Stealth
and +5% Magic Resistance. It's not terrible, but since it won't allow
me to cast Mage spells, it's not worth wearing.
  ---
*6: This +1 Short Sword always deals an extra 1d2 cold damage and has a
10% chance to phase foes.
  ---
*7: +1 Studded Leather with 35% Crushing Resistance.

7) Three Verbeeg and two Acolytes block your path, and one of the
Acolytes can (and will certainly try) to cast Hold Person, while the
other casts Entangle. This can make this fight messy. If you have
Web*1 and a Mage who can cast it (you should, if you have a
Fighter/Mage/Thief comparable to Syrenil) sneak forward and cast the
spell just in front of them. Remember, if you can't see them, they can't
see you. Cast multiple copies of the spell if you can, and shoot down
anything affected, and engage with the characters protected by the Rings
of Free Action.. Or you could just advance on the enemies with the two
characters protected by Rings of Free Action, provoking the Acolytes to
waste their first (and most dangerous) round of spells, then lead the
foes back to your party. Then again, you can also pelt them with
Silence 15' Radii to prevent the Acolytes from casting anything in the
first place. When victory is yours, continue past the dead and go
through a door at (x=3400, y=600) and to the next area (x=3600, y=50).

*1: Web can be purchased from Orrick, for about 240 gold.

Temple of the Forgotten God, Shrine of the Heartstone Gem (AR3603)
o======================================================================o
8) Hurrah, you made it! Unfortunately, you're the second invader to
break into this place. The Heartstone Gem has already been stolen. Boo.
Take the poison from the body of the Talonite and make a walk of shame
through back through the temple and return to Kuldahar.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Once you're back in town, report to Arundel. He'll use his super
Druid powers to.. give you another quest. This time you get to play
around in the belly of a dormant volcano. Onward! To the Dragon's Eye!
Oh, uh.. and be sure to sell off junk and restock on ammuntion before
you go..s

Note: After you head to Dragon's Eye, Chapter 1 is over and Chapter 2
will begin. If you want any of Orrick's items from earlier, buy them
now, as he'll change his inventory once Chapter 2 starts. If you're
going to buy anything, you might as well buy spell scrolls. The more
scrolls you have, the more spells your Mages will have.

Dragon's Eye, Exterior (AR4000)
o======================================================================o
1) Barely a day away my ass. 72 hours is NOT one day. In any case, when
you arrive you'll have to deal with some Ice Trolls. After verbeeg,
these guys are a blessing. Especially since they're more ice than Troll.
Anything that doesn't get back up after I put it down doesn't bother me.
The only noteworthy thing about them is the fact that they require
magical weapons to hurt them. The entrance to the Dragon's Eye is at
(x=500, y=200). But first..

***ITEM FISHING***
There's big incentive to go item fishing in (AR4001), as we can
potentially get one of two great items-a Potion of Magic Resistance,
and Boots of the Fox. The imbiber of the Potion of Magic Resistance will
gain a permenant +5% bonus to Magic Resistance-and that's a very, very
good thing, whereas the Boots of the Fox are the best boots in the game,
due to their Armor Class bonus. This is another dungeon where casting
Invisibility, checking the container of interest (x=3100, y=500)-in this
case a giant snake statue-comes in handy. On the other hand, you'll
have to fight a group of Lizardmen when you enter the area, quick-save,
use invisibility and check what random loot is dropping, and then reload
the quick-save if it's something good (boots or a potion), or reload
the hard-save and try again, so it can be a bit of a bother.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Now that we traveled to Dragon's Eye, we can.. return to Kuldahar and
see what new goodies Orrick has in stock! Well, you don't have to, and
you probably can't buy too much of it anyways, but since he just shifted
his stock I figure I might as well discuss it now.

Jasper's Ring of Shocking Grasp
You'll be able to use Shocking Grasp four times per day with this ring.
Shocking Grasp isn't a great spell, and it certainly doesn't warrant
20000~ gold.
  ---
Pemby's Wand of Many Missiles
This wand is more of a ranged weapon than a wand in the traditional
sense. Instead of being a charge-bearing item, it casts a single
Magic Missile on any target you use it on, with unlimited charges.
It's nothing we can't already do better with bows, however.
  ---
Rogue's Cowl
An interesting little hood, it gives a +2 bonus to your Armor Class,
increases your Stealth by +10%, and allows you to cast Blindness and
Color Spray each once per day. It can only be used by Thieves and
Rangers, however, and it doesn't protect against critical hits.
  ---
Shimmering Sash
The best item Orrick sells, the Shimmering Sash puts its wearer under
the constant effect of the Blur spell. "Well!" Huffs a noob insolently,
"How good can a 2nd-level Mage spell be?". Silly noob, the Blur spell
grants its target a +3 bonus to Armor Class and a +1 bonus to all Saves.
Having that effect on all the time is pretty awesome. Awesome enough
that I'd rather wear this Sash than anything else in Heart of Fury mode.
No joke. This is THE item to put around your waist in Icewind Dale. The
only downside? Only good characters can wear it. But all your characters
are good-aligned already, right..?

5th-Contact Other Plane*1

*1: Note that this is the first time you have access to the spell
'Contact Other Plane'. As I've mentioned elsewhere in this guide, this
spell summons a 'Planar Spirit', who will answer one question every time
you cast the spell. The questions possible change every chapter, and
depending upon what you know. Typically you can ask about specific NPCs,
the location of quest elements, and treasure. It's more interesting than
useful, in most cases, but it does give a bit of backstory that you
otherwise wouldn't have. I will not be providing this information in
the walkthrough.. simply because with this walkthrough it's not
necessary. Also, even though you can get the spell here, that doesn't
mean you'll necessarily be able to cast a 5th-level spell yet. I know
that for my triple-classers, 5th-level spells are still a bit off.
Anyways, if you want to know more about this spell, check out [COP001].

Lizard Man Caves (AR4001)
o======================================================================o
3) This level is infested with Lizardmen, which after Verbeeg.. well,
Lizardmen can do some serious damage (they were fond of hitting my
characters for sixteen damage, for some reason) but they just don't have
the staying power to make them as dangerous. You'll have to skirmish
with a group at the outset. Most of them will drop gold, but you can
also find Flaming Oil on them. Be especially wary of the Lizardmen
Shaman throughout this area, as some of them will cast Static Charge,
which can deal pretty brutal damage to one party member (on Insane
difficulty, I've had this spell deal 92 damage to one of my characters
before.) Fortunately, we're now higher level, so we have more spell
options. Using Web then attacking with the characters wearing Rings of
Free Action can win most fights (it's a tactic we'll be employing a
bit from here on out). Best of all, Lizardmen are susceptible to Sleep
(or at least the green ones are), unlike the undead and Verbeeg we have
been fighting. You can also combine Stinking Cloud and Animate Dead to
good effect-your summoned undead will be immune to the effects of the
Stinking Cloud, whereas living foes will not be. Hold Person also works
well. Use your spells to good effect, as our triple-classers aren't very
well protected by either Armor Class or Hit Points yet, and their
offensive capabilities are on the weak side.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Now, let's go on a murderous little loop. First, head north from the
entrance to find a small chamber with two chests in it. East of this
chamber you'll find a tunnel going north, looping around east, down
south, and finally back west to where you started. Along the way you'll
fight three small band of Lizardmen. Explore, kill, loot. Fun! Resist
the urge to cross the bridge to the south-don't consider any southern-
exploration, just go back to the beginning of the level.

***ITEMS***
(x=500, y=850) 85 gold, Dagger, Waterstar Gem, Antidote x15,
	       Scroll of Protection from Normal Missiles
(x=600, y=850) 97 gold, Oil of Speed, Bolts x20, Bullets +1 x20
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Once you're back where you started.. explore to the south! You all
saw that coming. Anyways, kill another band of Lizardmen and continue
your formerly forbidden southern ways. Beyond the Lizardmen you'll find
Bomardier Beetles-real pains in the ass if ever there were personified
ass-pains. When they engage in melee, they'll emit a cloud of acid in
a radius around themselves which does.. well, mediocore damage, but
when there are several of them at once (which there often are) it can
start to add up. Also, they can paralyze you, and your Rings of Free
Action won't do a damn thing to prevent it. These things just suck,
really; just try to shoot them to death before you get close, and if
that fails, lead with one character and hope they make their saves.
Their acid will have minimal effect (to the overall party, at least)
and with any luck they won't stun you.

***HoF***
In Heart of Fury, the Bombardier Beetles are even more annoying. This is
solely due to their higher Hit Points, which means they can fully take
advantage of any stunned characters, and are just hard to put away
quickly. Actually, it's not much harder than my first run-through was,
but with a great Armor Class, top-notch saves, and over 100 Hit Points
on every character, it doesn't seem like  this should still be such a
brutal fight. Also, there are a lot more Sword Spiders around in Heart
of Fury mode, ready to take advantage of you should your characters
falter against the Bombardier Beetles.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) You're now more or less in the southwestern corner of the map. Time
to explore to the east. You'll shortly come across some Wraith Spiders.
They can disease you (lowers your Strength temporarily), and they are
immune to non-magical weapons. Still, they're not very tough (and they
are worth 2800 experience points each on Insane difficulty!) Head east-
there are two paths-one leads over a bridge, the other leads.. well, to
a stream. Beyond the uncrossable stream are more spiders-including a
Sword Spider. The Sword Spider is no joke-it attacks fast, and can
quickly decimate a lightly armored character. Of course, the spiders
are across the water, and very, very stupid. They tend to just stand
there and allow you to shoot them to death. It's just a simple (and
cheap) way of kill these bugs without them being able to respond. And
isn't that what strategy is really all about?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Now that the spiders are all dead, head east across the bridge. You
will probably provoke some Phase Spiders as you head east-you'll just
have to put on your big-boy pants and fight them fairly (they wouldn't
be bothered by something as simple as a stream, anyways). If you get
poisoned by them, you must cast a Slow Poison spell or use an Antidote
immediately-it's pretty lethal if not cured. Once they're dead, explore
south to reach the stream we confounded the unphasing spiders at
earlier. Here you'll find the remains of Erevain-the Elf we met at the
Snowdrift Inn, back in Easthaven. Don't feel bad, however. He had suck
in his very DNA.

(x=1900, y=2300) Erevain's Broad Sword*1, Chain Mail, Medium Shield,
		 Arrows x11, Long Bow, 81 gold, Erevain's Journal*2,
		 Arrows of Fire x11*3, Acid Arrows x9*3

*1: Erevain's Broad Sword is a +2 specimen that also grants a +2 bonus
on saves versus wands and 10% acid resistance. It's a decent weapon
that I'll put on my Fighter/Mage/Thief, for those rare instances when
I want to try out a backstab.
  ---
*2: This is the journal of the elf at the inn in Easthaven, if you
remember. Xan, of course, is a sucky character you can recruit in
Baldur's Gate. If Erevain was anything like his cousin, we're better off
without him. Almost makes me want to play Baldur's Gate and feed Xan to
a Sword Spider too.. Ahh.. Irony.
  ---
*3: For the love of Zeus, do NOT use these arrows frivolously. We'll
have to deal with Trolls shortly, and unless you have a bunch of
flaming weapons stashed away some where, these are great ways to deal
with downed Trolls-and make sure they stay down.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) Backtrack to the entrance again, and from there head east. Go back to
the bridge to the south we ignored earlier and with great trepidation,
cross it. Trepidation optional. You'll probably have to smack around
some Lizard Men along the way. Continue southeast until you come to a
fork. Now, we're going to provoke a rather large fight, so let's prepare
a bit, shall we? First, memorize as many Web spells as you can. Then,
leave your party beyond the narrow tunnel west of the fork (if this
screams 'bottleneck' to you.. well, then you're probably schizophrenic.)
Once that's done, I take my party leader-Ilnathias-alone up the northern
fork. You'll find yourself in the court of the Lizard Man King. I could
go into some depth about this conversation, except that the conversation
lacks any. It's hard to be diplomatic when the other side regards you as
food. Anyways, a fight ensues. Don't stick around-run back to your
party, leading as many of the reptiles as you can. When they approach,
cast Web at the far end of the bottleneck (multiple Webs in the same
area stack, and it's very unlikely that anything will continually save
against two or three spells at once.) Attack in melee with the two
characters wearing the wonderful, wonderful Rings of Free Action and
have the others shoot/sling them down. How well does this strategy work?
Me = no damage, they = dead. Pretty good, I'd say. If the Shaman try to
be clever by standing back and casting spells, hit them with Silence
15' Radii spells. Amongst the general loot is a magical dagger,
Spinesheath*1, but that's not all. Return to the chamber that USED to
house the Lizard Man King's court and loot the snake statue for some
nice loot.

***HoF***
Same principles apply to the Lizardman King in Heart of Fury mode, try
to bottleneck and you'll be fine. Heck, a simple Haste is all you need.
I used a Symbol of Hopelessness just for funsies and it pretty much won
the fight outright. By the way, spamming five Symbols of Hopelessness
should win just about every Heart of Fury fight against living foes-
we'll be doing it a lot.

(x=3100, y=500) Star Diopside Gem x8, 88 gold, Scroll of Detect Evil,
		Scroll of Fireball*2, ~Ring of Resistance*3,
		Antidote x2, Scroll of Summon Monster I
		(2nd Play: Robe of Enfusing*4)
		(3rd Play: Potion of Magical Resistance*5)
		(4th Play: Ring of Intelligence*6)
		(7th Play: Boots of the Fox*7)
		(7-X Play: Shield Ring*8)

*1: Spinesheath is a great backstabber. Although it only has a +1 to
damage, its +5 THAC0 more than makes up for it. I keep it on my
Fighter/Mage/Thief for now, even though I don't ever really intend to
use it. Mostly I just like the name. Spinesheath. It really just says it
all, doesn't it? Syrenil will keep this handy for when she needs to
make backstabs-an admittably rare occurance.
  ---
*2: Fireball. Need I say more? Probably not, but I will anyways. This is
THE offensive spell for a Mage. Learn it, love it. Honestly, I tend to
just use buffs most of the time-a Haste or Slow spell will probably have
more of an effect on more fights than Fireball, but it's iconic, man.
  ---
*3: +10% bonus to fire and slashing attacks? Put it on anybody who gets
hit alot.. generally meaning start with the leading party members.
  ---
*4: Remember this? Orrick was trying to sell us one. Here you have a
chance to get it for free. It's not a worthy drop, however. We'll find
much better Mage armor later on.
  ---
*5: How can you say no to 5% permanent magic resistance?
  ---
*6: +1 to Intelligence, -1 to Constitution. Eh, no thanks.
  ---
*7: These boots give a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and increase your speed
by 40%. We'll find Boots of Speed later which double your speed, but
it's the Armor Class that makes the difference here. Being fast is fine
and all, but Haste does that just as well, and as long as you're just a
little faster than your foes-that's what really matters. On the other
hand, neither these boots nor the BOots of Speed are compatible with
Rings of Free Action.. but at least you'll still get the Armor Class
bonus from these (and there is an alternative we can use later that
will give us a limited protection from paralysis will allowing us to
keep our speed boosts). It should be obvious, but worth noting, that
these boots will not interfere with any other magical protection you
may have.
  ---
*8: This ring puts the wearer under the constant effects of the Shield
spell.. which is very nice. Unfortunately the ring can only be worn
by single-classed Mages, Mage/Clerics, or Mage/Theives. Of course, since
this item can't be used by the best Fighter-combos in the game, we need
not pay attention to it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Well, we just commited reptiliregicide and scored some decent loot.
All things considered, we've done pretty good. But, his highness
mentioned that they've been eating some villagers... we should probably,
you know, go look for them, or something. He also mentioned someone
called 'Yxunomei'. I'm sure we'll never hear about it again, though.
Anyways, backtrack to the bottleneck. This time, explore to the south,
where you'll find a bridge to the east, and another... well, not-bridge
to the south. Elegant, aren't I? It's what happens when one graduates
from Stewart County High School, in Dover, Tennessee. Ignore the bridge
and continue south to find.. more Lizard Men. There are two Shaman with
this band, and one of them will surely try to cast Hold Person. Lead
with your two ring-bearers while the rest of your party attacks the
archers with ranged weapons (casting a Web spell into the thick of
combat can take the pressure off your melee combatants.) Continue south
and kill all the reptiles you find. In a slave corral in the south-
eastern corner of the level, a little girl will initiate dialogue with
you and thank you for saving the villagers. You'll get a huge quest
reward. Huzzah! It's time to leave this level behind (x=3500, y=2300).

***REWARD***

Talonite Caves (AR4002)
o======================================================================o
1) Now, if you've played some video games before, you understand how
invariable they tend to be about certain issues. So let me throw this
out, as a consciousness-raiser. We never found Conlan's son, did we?
A sensible person would say "Lizards ate 'em" and move on with their
lives, but this is a video game-surely we would have found a trace-a
half-eaten corpse, a distinctive item on top of some reptile poop, a
sad message scratched into the dirt, or perhaps just a second-hand
heads-up from another villager.. but nothing. That means-by video game
logic-that he's still out there. And so he is, but there's a time limit
on finding him in this level, so don't leave, don't rest, and generally,
don't dick around. We'll set our sights on finding Conlan's son before
we bother with anything else.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) You're immediately confronted by two Lizardmen-kill them, and then
head west and slaughter any scaley things that stand in your way.
Continue following the path when it turns southwest, and when it forks
again, it's time to change strategy a bit. I've been mentioning it most
of the walkthrough, but the time has come-Trolls await us. To the south
another split awaits. To the south is a wooden bridge; to the east, our
destination; and to the west is a large chamber with an equally large
number of Trolls. My tactics are simple. Sneak ahead slowly with your
Fighter/Mage/Thief and cast Web (or several Webs) just outside of their
sight radius (there's one Troll conveniently placed at the mouth of the
cavern that makes a great target), then engage them with your characters
protected by Rings of Free Action. Good news! There's apparently a bug
tied to Trolls! If you kill them in a mundane fashion while they're
caught up in a Web spell, they lose their regeneration and they STAY
down! It doesn't work all the time, but it works most of the time, and
it's a great way to take them down. In fact, anything that inhibits
their mobility-the stun effects from weapons, Web, Hold Monster, and
even Slow spells-can be used to kill Trolls without having to meet the
typical fire/acid requirement. If more is required, break out flaming
weapons, use fire spells such as Burning Hands, Agannazar's Scorcher,
Melf's Acid Arrow, or Fireball. Smoke 'em if you've got 'em! The Flaming
Oil that the Lizard Men were dropping works, too, but they're also worth
some gold. Finally, you also have Arrows of Fire and Acid Arrows-it only
takes one to make sure a downed Troll stays down. Explore the entire
cavern after the intial Trolls are dead-there are bound to be straggling
Trolls hiding in the depths, and some Wraith Spiders.

***HoF***
In Heart of Fury you'll find more Trolls than in the normal game. Take
it slow unless you feel like fighting a half dozen Trolls all at once.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Once the Trolls have been tamed, backtrack to the bridge and promptly
ignore it. I now explore the tunnels to the east of the bridge, where a
trio of Lizard Man Shaman await. I hit them with a volley of Silence 15'
Radius before moving in for the kill. Beyond are some Wraith Spiders,
and here melee takes over. Continue east, then southeast, then west
until you find some kids. Conlan's son is at roughly (x=950, y=1330),
although they'll all simply be called 'Captive Villager'. Talk to him
and tell him that you've cleared the way for him, and he'll run off.
Whew. Now that Sheemish is saved we can continue through the level
normally.

***REWARD***
(For rescuing Conlan's son, Sheemish)
EXP	24000
Misc	Conlan's Hammer*

*When you get back to town and talk to Sheemish, he'll give you the key
to the chest in the store. Or you could just cast Knock on the chest and
steal it. Either way.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) There was a path east of the entrance we ignored near the beginning
of the level-and for good reason. It heads to the next area, and we've
still got plenty of map to explore over to the west. Cross the bridge to
the southwest that we ignored in the previous Steps. More Trolls and
Wraith Spiders. Eventually the path will turn sharply to the south, and
note the rock-strewn corner-it's a great natural bottleneck-the kind we
use to turn large fights into the sites of resounding victories. And so
it will be. I leave most of my party in the corner and sneak south with
Syrenil. The southern pass will lead to a large chamber where you'll
find a large, stepped structure, on top of which is a Talonite Priest
and some Trolls. I play it safe and get the Talonite's attention
(nothing says "Hello!" like an arrow to the face!) and run back to my
party. The following ensues-Talonites and Trolls attack up the narrow
corner. With any luck, the Talonites will start by casting spells (again
with the Hold Person, be sure you're leading with your ring bearers and
they'll laugh it off). This gums up the works, and allows you to place
a humble Web spell in the corner. Shoot Webbed foes down or blast them
with spells, and if anybody makes it through, have your Fighters at the
end of the bottleneck to greet them. My ring-bearers took some damage,
but a win is a win.

***HoF***
I start out by backstabbing one of the Talonites, then running back to
my party who takes up their customary position in the tunnel to the
north. Once the horde of Trolls and Talonites show up (probably
bolstered by Prayer and Recitation) my melee fighters step up and stop
them. A Haste, a few Incediary Clouds, and Symbols of Hopelessness end
the fight.

Note from Lee:
On one of the Talonite Priests, I found something called the 'Holy
Chaos Deck', a deck of cards that, 'casts a random beneficial spell
centered on the user' (not usable by Lawful characters).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Explore to the south where you provoked the Talonites. There are
bound to be some Trolls straggling around, so smite them. You'll find
Mother Egenia of Ilmater is at (x=1220, y=1960). Talk to her for
rewards. She'll reveal that she-unlike that pussy Arundel-decided to
be more active about thwarting this evil. She roamed out into the
mountains and allowed herself to be abducted. Doesn't that sound a lot
more Druidic than Arundel, sitting in a house worrying about the world?
They got their roles reversed! Mother Egenia will stay behind and heal
(at a price) until you slay the evil. Yay.. She'll also watch over you
while you rest and make sure you don't get attacked, which can be
useful. You can find the villagers you saved in the tunnels to the east,
but they have nothing interesting to say.

***REWARD***
(For saving Egenia and numerous villagers from the Talonites)
EXP	36000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Backtrack to the beginning of the level. It's now time to explore
the previously unexplored tunnels to the east. Kill any Lizard Men you
see until you find a fork, at which you'll have to deal with more pesky
Phase Spiders. Again, creep forward slowly and try to lure the critters
back to you, as down the southern path is a chamber full of baddies we'd
be better off handling without Phase Spiders around.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Once the Phase Spiders are dead, creep forward with your party to
provoke the critters in the southern room, where you'll find Sword
Spiders, Bombardier Beetles, and-worst of all-Trolls. This is obviously
a cheap attempt to combine the attack speed of the Sword Spiders and the
Bombardier Beetle's ability to stun, and if it works-you're probably
going to lose a character (which for me means a reload). I engage with
my ring-bearers and bottleneck the foes at the fork, while Syrenil casts
a web. My melee combatants attack the Sword Spiders (who will be immune
to Web). I know we're abusing this strategy, but that's because.. well,
it works.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) Clear whatever opposition presents itself and ignore the southern
chamber for now. We just killed whatever we could because.. well, we
want to explore the northern tunnels, and the assfaces to the south
would have attacked us when we walked past. Continue east up the
northern tunnel and you'll encounter some Bombardier Beetles-yeah,
that's right, more of these fuckers. Get used to it, this tunnel is
crawling with them, although the game sees fit to throw a few Boring
Beetles at you, too. Emphasis on the 'boring', these things are weaker
than Bombardier Beetles. No stun, to acid, they're probably just there
to draw your fire from Bombardier Beetles, the real threat. Crush
beetles as you head east, then south. At the end of this loathsome path
you'll find the body of a dead.. well, a dead person, anyways.

***ITEMS***
(x=3530, y=1300) 108 gold, Battle Axe +2: Defender*1, Long Sword of
Confusion +2*2.

*1: A +2 Battle Axe with a two point bonus to Armor Class, the armor
bonus stacks with other protections as well. This is a wonderful
weapon, really. It's just a shame my triple-class party doesn't have
any real use for it.
  ---
*2: Instead of stunning enemies, you confuse them. I hand this off to
my Fighter/Mage/Thief.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Backtrack again to the last fork. It's time to explore the southern
chamber where we fought our last big battle. If you don't remember where
this is.. lay off the drugs. Continue south and murder any Trolls,
Spiders, or whatnot you find-stupid stragglers. In the chamber south of
this one you'll find a spiraling tunnel-and affront to natural cavern
geology if ever there was one. This serves but one purpose-to waste more
of your time, and to squeeze a few more Trolls into the level.
The next area is at (x=2900, y=2100).

***ITEM FISHING***
There's quite a disparity in the loot that can drop next level, from
a single magical bolt, to the best Cross Bow you've seen so far. If
you are desperately searching for Cross Bows.. well, then bad news-this
isn't an easy run. You'll have several (rather large) scripted battles,
traps, and then a major fight with a necromancer and her undead minions
before you get a shot at the treasure. It's more trouble than it's
worth, really. If you want to try, the rewarding container is at
(x=3170, y=1900).

Presio's Domain (AR4003)
o======================================================================o
1) Good riddance trolls, hello undead. As soon as you enter the level
an Undead Lieutenant will open dialogue with you. As usual, regardless
of what you say, a fight ensues. This can be a pretty rough, if not
straight-forward, fight with the Undead Lieutenant and its legion of
Cold Wights. Cold Wights are immune to non-magical weapons, so your
archery isn't going to be much use. My multi-classed party has two
saving graces, however. First, I have hit 5th level as a Mage on my
characters, so now the ultimate combat buff-Haste-comes into play.
Second, Holy Smite works wonders on the undead here. Sure, its damage
is pretty low right now, but if you get a small horde of Cold Wights
around you, one Holy Smite can deal modest damage to all of them
(plus a chance of blinding!). Use the two spells every time the Undead
Lieutenant summons a host of Cold Wights. My triple-classers just
aren't explosive enough melee combatants to chop them all down easily
without spells.

Note: If you scored The Snow Maiden's Reaver earlier, now is not the
time to be using it. It will not harm undead, much less undead critters
named something as revealing as 'Cold Wight'.

***HoF***
Oh glorious Invisosmite! Hallowed art thou name! If you prepare by
making the entire party Invisible before heading down, a team of very,
very high-level Clerics (level 20 wasn't good enough, but level 30 was)
can simply walk through the level and leisurely smite all the Cold
Wights here.. except for the Undead Lieutenants. Oh, but it is wondrous
to kill all its minions throughout the level, then just walk around and
giggle at its idle threats..

Note from Lee:
Because I have a different party makeup - just single and two-class
multi's - I am probably one or two levels higher and was able to defeat
the entire group of enemies in a straight melee fight while suffering
only minor damage. It's important to note that I am NOT playing HoF.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) I'm nearing some potentially difficult battles ahead, and the time
has come for me to dual-class. I simply cannot go much further without
spells. Cold Wights are easy to kill and plentiful, and they give 1400
experience per kill (2800 in Insane difficulty!). Now I just rest and
spawn baddies until I'm leveled enough to continue on. Grind to taste.
If you don't have dual-classers, and you're following the new multi-
class 7th-playthrough party, you obviously don't need to grind here,
although grinding until you're at least 7th-level will make you immune
to the whole instant death effect of Cloudkill, a spell that will be
used by a few foes quite shortly.

Note from Lee:
After only minor grinding (3 sessions) my entire party is at least
Level 7 in all classes. I return to Kuldahar to sell off stuff and buy
some spells so my Mages are fully equipped, as suggested by our author
in the next step.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Do as much leveling as you care to do-or continue playing to score
some choice gear. Be sure to head to town and re-equip your characters
to suit their new roles, if necessary, and pick up some Mage spells for
your new Mages, if you want them to be able to do anything. Either way,
you're ready to continue on, no? There are two staples of this level-
undead, and traps. Traps, everywhere. Well, not quite everywhere, yet,
but they'll become more numerous shortly. We've got two paths we can
follow, either east, along a wooden path, or south. Head east along the
planks where you'll meet another Undead Lieutenant. This time the
necromancer controlling it reveals that they are working the 'will of
Talona and our blessed ally, Yxunomei'. *gasp* It's that name again!
Who knew? The necromancer also reveals that it didn't freeze the passes,
the 'Old Enemy' did. Apparently this 'Old Enemy' is the bugger we are
looking for, and again, the enemy of our enemy is not our friend. It
will, however, reveal that Lysan was not part of their little group.
These guys like reptiles, and reptiles don't like cold. At this point
one has to wonder if there's anybody out there who doesn't have it in
for Kuldahar. Anyways, the Lieutenant grows tired of answering your
questions and attacks, along with another horde of Cold Wights.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Continue south and you'll find more Cold Wights, along with another
Undead Lieutentant (this one isn't talkative like the last two were).
Continue south and you'll encounter some Blast Skeletons. These things
suck-they do nothing but try to engage the party, and if you hit them,
they'll explode in a Snilloc's Snowball Swarm. Shoot them before they
get near your party. These bastards aren't even worth any experience.
Lame.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Now turn west until you find some wooden planks, along which are
some traps (x=1190, y=1440), (x=900, y=1540), and (x=1420, y=1350).
Continue west until you find a fork-being weary to watch out for lurking
Blast Skeletons and Cold Wight stragglers. You'll eventually come to a
fork in the path-a planked route to the northwest which leads to some
Blast Skeletons and another trap (x=700, y=1270), and eventually back
north to the beginning of the level-and a path to the Southwest, where
we'll find an Undead Lieutenant again. He'll talk shit and summon
another horde of Cold Wights to harass you.

***TRAPS***
(x=700, y=1270)
(x=900, y=1540)
(x=1190, y=1440)
(x=1420, y=1350)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Continue south over the broken bodies of the undead you smote then
follow some wooden planks to the east. Another trap awaits to annoy you
at (x=1400, y=2100). Keep going until you reach a bridge. Deal with
any Blast Skeletons you find and endure the Undead Lieutenant one more
time. He won't have any Cold Wights left to throw at you this time.
Cross the bridge and disarm the trap at the far (eastern) end
(x=2450, y=2250). Traps abound to the northeast, but first, head over
to the building due east of the bridge, where we face more active
dangers.

***TRAPS***
(x=1400, y=2100)
(x=2450, y=2250)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Inside this round structure is a Mage named Presio, some Poison
Zombies, and Imbued Wights. Imbued Wights are old friends of ours, but
Poison Zombies are new. They're not nearly as resistant to missile
weapons as Skeletons are (they only ignore 20% of piercing/missile
damage), but as their name implies, they can poison you. Never fear,
however, this poison is very weak and short lasting, so it doesn't
really warrant your attention. Prepare with whatever spells you have-a
Web at the door can slow foes down, and if you have any 5th-level Mages
or better, it's time to test out that Haste. Sneaking forward with
Syrenil and launching a pre-emptive Fireball also is fun, but failing
that, I just head forward with a character to lure the enemies within
outside. I wait with my party to the west of the arch leading to the
structure. Again, this arch makes a suitable target for Web. when
Presio shows herself, I give her the attention of all my archers. The
fewer spells she casts, the better. She's fond of casting Cloudkill,
a smart choice considering her undead minions will be immune to it.
Don't play her game and end up in a melee with her minions while stuck
in a Cloudkill spell. If you engage the Poison Zombies in the arch where
you cast your Web, she'll tend to cast a Cloudkill there. If that
happens, retreat around the corner and chop down any Poison Zombies
coming out of the structure. She'll also cast Haste, Protection from
Normal Arrows (which is no fun) and offensive spells. With the multi-
class party, just make sure you avoid the Cloukill spell at all costs,
as it will likely result in instant death if you're 6th level or lower.
Just remember, she tends to cast the spell at the archway leading to
her dwelling, so if you run in with a character under the effects of a
Shield spell to absorb the Magic Missiles from the Cold Wights, then
retreat, she'll cast the spell harmlessly at the entrance. Just let her
undead waddle out and confront you, put them down with melee aggression
(boosted by Haste) then wait for the Cloudkill to wear off. Of course,
grinding around here a bit will prevent this. When Presio falls, she'll
leave behind 226 gold, a Hammer Flail +2*1, Presio's Dagger*2, and there
Necromancer's Robe*3. Before you go crazy looting, there are several
traps that need to be disarmed, so scan around.

***HoF***
In Heart of Fury Mode Presio is accompanied by another Mage, blandly
named 'Presio's Apprentice', and by a warrior named.. 'Warrior'. More
troublesome, however, are the Imbued Wights, just waiting to blast you
with Magic Missile. Three Wights shooting five missile each, each doing
eight through ten damage per hit.. that adds up to about 120-150
damage.. let's just say that's damage we don't need to start a fight
with, and I wouldn't rely on magic resistance. Unfortunately for Presio
and her goons.. Invisosmite! Heh, heh.. yeah, this was where Invisosmite
was born, actually. I was goofing around (goofing around is a technical
term for 'strategizing', just like the Republican term 'legitimate rape'
is slang for 'quit lying and have your God-given baby, you filthy slut')
and trying to probe Presio's stronghold with a Cleric to see if any of
the undead were placed foolishly close enough to the edge to be
susceptible to some smiting. Then my brain started working, and I
decided that since everything in this game is pathetically incapable of
detecting Invisible foes that I should try going Invisible and just walk
in and see what exploded. The answer? For a high-level Cleric-every
undead should die, just leaving Presio, her apprentice, and.. Warrior.
They just don't stand a chance against a Heart of Fury party without
their undead meat-shields. Presio doesn't have too many new tricks, but
once she resorts to lower end spells is when you actually have to worry-
again, Magic Missile deals some wretched damage. The Warrior will drop
some Bolts +1 and a suit of Plate Mail +1, while Presio's Apprentice
will drop a Mage Robe of Fire Resistance and Bracers of Defense A.C. 8.

Note from Lee:
While not in HoF mode, I did get Presio's Apprentice and his minions
coming at me from the northeast. I keep my archers near the east end of
the bridge and start the encounter at the arch, then retreat and wait
for the Apprentice and all the other baddies to show up. I can easily
take them all out by letting them come to me, and then enter the round
building once everything is dead. I move my lead character to the arch
and trigger Presio's poison fart cloud, wait it out, then go after him
in force - he dies rather easily.

*1: A +2 Flail that has a 15% chance to stun, It's a pretty awesome
weapon for this point of the game. I'm sure you can find a home for it
on some Fighter/Mage/Cleric or another.
  ---
*2: This +2 Dagger has a chance to poison foes when struck, although
they are entitled to make a Save vs. Death to avoid it. It's a decent
weapon, although whether it's superior to Spinesheath or not is
debatable. An extra point of damage and poison, or three more points of
THAC0? If this helps, Presio's Dagger can keep Trolls down.
  ---
*3: These robes drop your Armor Class to 6, give +3% Magic Resistance,
and impart a +3 bonus to your saves versus paralysis/poison/death magic.
These certainly make Orrick's Robes of Infusing seem like a big waste
of money, and they're easily the best bit of Mage armor we've found.
I put them on Eraithul-my 5th-place Fighter/Mage/Cleric. He's wearing
Scale Mail anyways, and being so far back in the roster, isn't likely
to get better hand-me-down armor in a while.
  ---
*4: +4 THAC0 and +4 damage, and two attacks a round. Win. This is the
best Cross Bow you'll find for a long, long time.
  ---
*5: +4 THAC0 and +4 damage, +1 bonus to Armor Class, and +10% Missile
Resistance. But it doesn't address the problem of a Crossbow's
inherent slow rate of fire. Not so win.
  ---
*6: There are many ways to deal with Giants in this game.. well.. okay,
the best way to deal with them is by casting Haste and chopping them
up. Slinging 1d4+4 damage stones at them is not a superior way to take
them down compared to, say, a high Strength Fighter with Grand Mastery.
This sling is a +1 Sling that counts as a +4 weapon versus Giants.
  ---
*7: This uniquely-named crossbow gives a +2 bonus to damage and a +5
bonus to THAC0. Sadly, at one attack per round, it's not really worth
using.
  ---
*8: +3 THAC0, +2 damage, 15% resistance to missile damage, and 5%
Magic Resistance. Sure, the Magic Resistance is nice, and the combat
stats are identical to the Long Bow +2: Defender, but I'd rather have
the +2 Armor Class, instead.
  ---
*9: Now two of my characters can have Haste. Huzzah.
  ---
*10: This spell is a great debuff. It forces foes to save (with a -2
penalty!) or become confused, all but taking them out of the fight.
Sure, Chaos is a better spell, but until you get it, this is the go-to
debuffer.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) Nothing left to do now but head to the next level.. But this is more
of a chore than you might expect. You're unlikely to encounter any
significant number of undead, but as you make your way northeast from
the structure, you'll run across traps galore. There's simply nothing
else you can do but creep along with your Thief and detect them all.
It's not the first-and it won't be the last-time I wished we earned
experience from disarming traps.. The entrance to the next level can
be found at (x=3400, y=350).

***ITEM FISHING***
There are a few random weapons on the next level-two in one chest, in
fact. Most of the weapons therein are more interesting than game-
changing, and few will be useful for terribly long. There's a great
mid-level Flail and a few interesting Daggers. The only problem? You'll
have to go through a bit of bother to get to it. I honestly wouldn't
bother, but if you wish to try, the container in question is at
(x-2650, y=800).

Eldathyn Temple (AR4004)
o======================================================================o
1) From where you appear head north, then east, and you'll be greeted by
a priest named Albion. He insists that he and his fellows follow Eldath,
a pacifistic religion, and he will invite you to seek the aid of their
healer, named Sharra. Sure.. play along.

Note: If you had a Paladin in your party, they would sniff out Albion
and his laughable ruse the first time he talked to you, immediately
provoking a fight. Also, if you have an Intelligence of 16 or greater
you can talk to Albion a second time and ask him about the Heartstone
Gem. He'll slip up and mention the Temple of the Forgotten God, blowing
his cover.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Go through the door at (x=830, y=1330) to find Geelo the Librarian
(x=900, y=1180). He'll give you access to the books in this room (the
northern room is restricted). Ask about the Kuldahar abductions and
the Heartstone Gem, to no avail, and best of all, purchase some spell
scrolls from him. He sells scrolls of Blur, Flame Arrow, Monster
Summoning I, Lightning Bolt, and Ice Storm. Buy what you will. You can
loot the books here, too, but they're pretty bogus. Note that picking
the locked door to the forbidden library (x=750, y=1100) will provoke
the Eldathyns. In fact, if you try to pick the locks of ANY locked door
it will provoke them. Not very good pacifists, eh?

Note: If you have an Intelligence of 13 or higher you can trick Geelo
into visiting with Albion, which will allow you to pick the lock to the
doot at (x=750, y=1100) and take a gander at the incriminating bookshelf
at (x=650, y=950). If you do this, the next time you talk to Albion you
can call him out.

<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Well, that was lame. Go through the large door at (x=1000, y=1450),
then through another, smaller door (x=1550, y=1400), beyond which you'll
find Sharra the Healer (x=1720, y=1320). She'll.. well, let you rest
safely, and she'll heal you (for a price). She also has a lot of nothing
to say about Kuldahar and the Heartstone Gem. Speaking about a lot of
nothing, if you explore to the northwest you can find two rooms, the
doors to which are at (x=1000, y=500) and (x=1350, y=400), both of which
contain bookshelves.

***ITEMS***
(x=1100, y=200) Animals Are Your Friend, On Non-Violence
(x=1000, y=350) History of the North I, History of the North II,

<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) From Sharra's room head southeast and explore a room, the door to
which is at (x=1440, y=1880), which contains a bookshelf with some
useless loot on it. Yay. Continue to the southeast to find an exotic
rug. You'll get the following floating text:

"This rug is of extremely high quality and appears to be of foreign
design. The recurring symbol in the pattern is that of a golden carp."

Apparently this is something worth noting, although how an expensive
rug seems out of place compared to the rest of the crazy going on here-
the fact that these fools claim to be pacifists when surrounded by
legions of undead, Talonites, Trolls, and Lizard Men for example-is
beyond me.

***ITEMS***
(x=1600, y=1800) Philosophy of Kara-Tur
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Well, this dog won't hunt, my friend! We need to go talk to Albion
about his.. his.. his 'rug'! Confront him about it, and well, he's
apparently as bored with this paper-thin facade of absurdity as we are.
He'll babble about reptiles being the 'master race', and mention Sseth
and Yxunomei-his princess. *gasp*! It's that name again! Double-damn!
Anyways, Albion and his 'Eldathyns' will attack. It's a good idea to
cast a Web just beyond the large doorway to the northeast, as plenty
of foes will be coming down that way, including Eldathyns and Yuan-Ti.
The only exceptions are Albion, who is quite vulnerable all alone
standing against our party, and Geelo the Librarian, who will pop out
to cast some Mage spells. Yuan-Ti and Yuan-Ti Elite are just mediocre
foes that either fight in melee, or use bows. They aren't bothered by
Holy Smite, so we can ignore that spell again. Slow and Confusion,
however, are both great spells to use against Yuan-ti, which we'll be
fighting a good number of in this and the next level. With a few Web
spells here, you should have no trouble luring all your foolish foes to
their doom. If you have a high enough level Mage, now is a great time to
cast Confusion on the foes-on its own, or in conjunction with the Webs
(which tends to cause baddies to cluster together, making for more fun
with spells like Confusion). Learn to cast Confusion on anything and
everything that's not undead or a construct, it's a wonderful spell,
and we'll be abusing it (and spells like it) for the rest of the game.
Loot Albion to obtain Albion's Key*1. Geelo will drop Bracers of
Defense A.C. 6*2, and two Potions of Invisibility. While we're nearby,
we might as well loot the forbidden library beyond the door at
(x=750, y=1100)-unless any Eldathyns have any objections.. what? No?
Good then.

***ITEMS***
(x=650, y=950) Secret Societies, Scroll of Summon Monster I,
	       Scroll of Flame Arrow, Potion of Mind Focusing,

***REWARD***
(For exposing Albion and his cohorts)
EXP	24000

*1: Albion's key opens the locked doors throughout this level, although
you don't NEED it to actually unlock any of them. They can all be
unlocked via Pick Locks, or with the Knock spell.
  ---
*2: Bracers that reduce your Armor Class as if you were wearing armor.
The good news is that anybody can wear them. These are ideal for Mages,
Thieves, Druids, and other armor-challenged characters. These are, at
least, a viable replacement for one of my lower-ranked characters, who
are unlikely to get any hand-me-down armor any time soon.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Now, there's one annoying thing we should deal with now that we've
got the whole level against us. Every so often some rat-bastard called
'The High Summoner' will work his magic and summon some foes to hound
us. Since he'll occassionally summon Trolls to come hound us, I make it
a priority to hunt him down quickly. I'm not made of Arrows of Fire,
dammit! Return to the evil carpet and go east through a door at
(x=1720, y=2200). Continue east, then north into a room with steps
leading down the east. Kill whatever Yuan-ti you find here before you
go through the door at (x=2920, y=1800) to find the High Summoner
(x=3070, y=1930). He'll speak to you a bit and make some empty threats.
Teach him some manners and rejoice-no more pain in the ass summoned
critters bothering you.

***HoF***
The one big change in this part of the level is the addition of several
Yuan-ti Mages in the eastern part of the level. These critters will also
show up on Insane difficulty (when you activate Heart of Fury mode it
raises the difficulty to Insane by default, but again, Insane difficulty
and Heart of Fury mode are NOT the same thing, I just refuse to bother
with the differences, since if you're playing Heart of Fury-the hardest
difficulty in the game-you're also playing on Insane difficulty.)
The Yuan-ti Mages will cast Stoneskin on the first round and Protection
from Normal Missiles on the second, no matter where in the level you
are. Once they're done buffing, they'll come after you. They're fond
of using spells like Charm Person, Feeblemind, Vitrolic Sphere, and
Magic Missile. They're not well protected from mind-affecting effects,
however. Symbol of Hopelessness puts them in their place.

Note from Lee:
The Yuan-Ti Mages also appear for me (I'm not in HoF mode), so I would
suggest advancing carefully no matter what difficulty you're playing.
Also, I have had Yuan-Ti and Trolls come down the hallway from the north
to attack the party from the rear. This fight can get out of hand fairly
quickly if you're not careful. I Haste the party and run thru the first
area as quickly as possible to get to the High Summoner. Once he's dead
I go back and kill off the critters I left behind.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Leave the High Summoner's room and head north, smiting any Yuan-ti
you come across. Loot the statue at (x=3330, y=850) and some pillows
(x=2850, y=1000) for some goodies, then continue west through some
large doors to find the High Ritualist, merrily sitting down to dine
with his fellow Yuan-ti. Can snakes even sit? Oh well. Another battle,
another dose of Confusion, and this fight is over. Loot the small room
beyond the door at (x=2500, y=1000) for some good loot for a change,
then loot the statue at (x=2420, y=440).

(x=2850, y-1000) Potion of Stone Giant Strength, Potion of Strength.
(x-2650, y=800) ~Studded Leather +2: Shadowed*2, ~Corrosive Hammer +2*3,
		Potion of Mind Focusing, Potion of Stone Form,
		Arrows +1 x20.
		(2nd Play: The Mace of Weal and Woe*4, Mage Dagger +2*5)
		(3rd Play: Selune's Promise*6, Fire Dagger +2*7)
		(4th Play: Ol'Withery*8, Corrosive Hammer +2)
		(5th Play: Corrosive Hammer +2, Life Dagger +2*9)
		(6th Play: Fire Dagger +2, Fast Flail +2*10)
		(7th Play: Peacekeeper*11)
(x=2420, y=450) Oil of the Serpent's Scales, 252 gold,
		Potion of Hill Giant Strength

*1: The Blur Deck lets you cast Blur on yourself. Obviously this boon
would be wasted on characters who can already cast the spell. It's
decent for a little while, and can serve any of your front-liners as
a decent buff. Once everybody obtains a Shimmering Sash, however, you
obviously won't need it.
  ---
*2: Like the Studded Leather +1: Shadowed, but better. I don't have any
use for this suit of armor, either.
  ---
*3: A +2 War Hammer that has a 30% chance to deal 1d4 Acid Damage. This
is win for two reasons-first, acid kills Trolls. Second, it's a +2
weapon.
  ---
*4: Although is has an interesting sounding name, it's only a +1 Mace
that's +2 against Lawful creatures. I'd rather just have a +2 weapon
that's +2 all the time.. To help it, this Mace also gives a +1 bonus to
all Saves and has a 13% chance of cursing targets. It's superior to
those old Morning Stars +1, at least. You cannot use this weapon if your
alignment is lawful.
  ---
*5: Another Mage Dagger, as a +2 variety, it grants a bonus 1st and
2nd level Mage spell.
  ---
*6: This stupid weapon is a +1 Mace that acts as a +3 weapon versus
Spectral Undead. It also has a 2% chance to cause 'Morale Failure' in
the wielder, making the weapon a complete waste.
  ---
*7: It's a +2 Dagger, that has a 50% chance to deal 1d4 fire damage,
which makes it an effective anti-Troll weapon.
  ---
*8: An interesting +2 Dagger that has a 2% chance of casting Finger of
Death on the target. It's a low chance, indeed, but it's still at least
some extra damage, and possibly instant death.
  ---
*9: A humble +2 Dagger that has a 15% chance to heal its wielder for
1d6 Hit Points upon attacking. It also grants a +5 bonus to your
maximum Hit Points.
  ---
*10: Certainly the best bludgeoning weapon we've found thus far. It's a
+2 weapon that gives its wielder an extra attack per round.
  ---
*11: This is the first +3 weapon you can find all game-too bad it's a
Club.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) From the banquet room, if you head southwest you'll find yourself
knocking on the northern door leading to the room where Sharra the
Healer was (x=1800, y=1200). Of course, this room wasn't interesting
the first time we were here, so why bother going there again? Go through
a northern door to the west of the banquet room (x=1900, y=440) and
then through another, still-closed door (x=1650, y=500). Beyond you'll
find a foursome of adventurers. Their leader, Marchon of Waterdeep, will
tell you about the sorry story that led to them being captured. Play
nice, and when you get a chance, have them watch over you while you
sleep. It's free rest! The real perk, however, isn't their sad story or
their watchfulness, but their gear. I mean, they're in a room full of
corpses, probably presumed dead with the rest of their caravan, and who
is going to tell anybody otherwise? Attack and kill them-they shouldn't
pose too much of a problem to a well-rested party who gets the jump on
them. They'll leave behind the following loot;

Marchon of Waterdeep-Plate Mail Armor, a Large Shield, a Flaming Long
		     Sword +2*1, and 121 gold.

Cristiana Knight-Plate Mail Armor, a Potion of Extra Healing, a Medium
		 Shield, a Morning Star +1, and 78 gold.

Iholikan Quinval-Chain Mail +1, Long Bow, Arrows of Fire x20, a Long
		 Sword +1, Arrows +2 x20, Arrows x40, and 54 gold.

Reise Coppersky-Mage Dagger +2*2, and 102 gold.

The only downside to killing them? If they're dead, you won't be able
to return to them when you need to sleep. You can still go back to
(AR4003) to rest, but there's a chance you'll have to deal with Cold
Wights, who love to interrupt your sleep. It's not all bad, though. You
could probably use the extra experience.

*1: This is a +2 Long Sword that deals 1d3 fire damage with every hit,
no 50% crap. It also gives a +10% bonus to Fire Resistance. Very nice,
and absolutely wonderful against Trolls.. except by now, you're pretty
much done dealing with Trolls. At least, for a while.
  ---
*2: This Dagger gives an Armor Class bonus of +1 and allows you to
memorize one additional 1st and 2nd level Mage spell. Oh. And it's got
a +2 enhancement bonus.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Return to the High Summoner's room and head south into some
unexplored rooms. Turn east and continue into a room with a brazier,
and with some trepidation, go through the door at (x=3400, y=2450).
Now would be an excellent time to restock, sell off junk, and all that
rot.

***ITEM FISHING***
There are a few items that can be fished for in the next area-even one
chest that randomly gives you nothing good at all! No fun. On the other
hand, the best item you can fish for is one of two shields than can
drop. You'd have to run through traps, Yuan-ti, and generally it would
be quite a hassle, so I don't bother. The container that might stiff
you is at (x=450, y=200), whereas the shields can be found within the
container at (x=1350, y=400).

Yxunomei's Stronghold (AR4005)
o======================================================================o
1) When you arrive, you'll be greeted by an 'Odd Little Girl;, who will
ramble chaotic nonesense before vanishing. She'll be doing this
throughout the level, so get used to it. Head north and you'll encounter
a band of Yuan-ti, the Odd Little Girl will warn you to turn back, and
a fight will ensue. Focus missile fire on the Yuan-ti Priest to disrupt
it, or shut it up with Silence 15' Radius. Once it's dead, engage and
cut down the Yuan-ti Elite. Pay special attention to archers, as they'll
readily drop Arrows +1. Continue north a bit further and the Odd Little
Girl will babble at you again. Three times in one Step? Good grief..
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) The quick way to the end of the level is to simply follow the winding
path, opening doors after each segment. Yes, yes, it's a snake motif,
I get it. But what fun is that? Go through the door north of where the
Odd Little Girl last appeared (x=600, y=1350). Disarm a trap on the
stairs beyond (x=500, y=1200) and go through another door to the north
(x=500, y=1000). Beyond you'll encounter a Yuan-ti Priest and some
melee Yuan-ti. Shut up the Priest, and slice up the melee fighters.
Go through another door to the west (x=330, y=750), beyond which you'll
find another, similar group of baddies. Handle them the same way, then
head north to find a room full of treasure. Well, it's about time!
Stupid snake-ridden dungeon.. Oh, and be wary of traps.

***ITEMS***
(x=300, y=200) Black Opal x2, Scroll of Non-Detection, 124 gold
(x=450, y=200) Tchazar Gem x5, Potion of Fire Resistance
	       (2nd Play: In addition to the previous, I found the
	       Short Sword 'Spell Diver'*1)
	       (3rd Play: Instead of 'Spell Diver' I found a
	       Bastard Sword of Action +1*2)
	       (4th Play: The Sword of Days*3)
	       (6th Play: Intercession*4)
	       (7th Play: Bastard Sword +2: Life Giver*5)
(x=500, y=400) Potion of Healing x3, Pearl Necklace, 303 gold

***TRAPS***
(x=500, y=1200)
(x=300, y=200)
(x=450, y=200)

*1: This +2 Short Sword is cast as a Mage-killer, as it has a 50%
chance to 'nullify the target's ability to cast spells for two rounds.'
I think death is the best Mage-killer, and Short Swords aren't terribly
good for that in my party.
  ---
*2: A Bastard Sword +1 that grants an additional attack per round. It's
a decent weapon, but we're looking for +2 or better weapons by now.
  ---
*3: A Short Sword +3 that gives immunity to Haste and Slow, and has a
25% chance to slow the target. Haste is essential to my battle plan, and
few enemies cast Slow. I don't bother.
  ---
*4: A Long Sword +1 that gives a +2 bonus to AC. We've already found a
better Battle Axe, and since it's not +2, it's really not up to snuff.
  ---
*5: A +2 Bastard Sword with a 5% chance to heal the user for 1d10
points of damage.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Now for our tunnel-tackling tactic. Have your Thief sneak, then open
the door to the south (x=1000, y=1700). The Odd Little Girl will pester
you again. When she's done, run back with your Thief and hide again,
without provoking the Yuan-ti beyond. Each tunnel typically has Yuan-ti
and traps in them, so rushing in after the Yuan-ti is likely to end
with you suffering severely. If you're quick, you can head into the
tunnel with a sneaking character, detect the traps, disarm them, and
run back before becoming visible. Once the traps are disarmed in front
of the Yuan-ti, run in and slaughter them all. In the next particular
tunnel segment are there Yuan-ti Elite archers and a trap at
(x=1020, y=1840). There's another trap beyond the offending Yuan-ti at
(x=1340, y=2100).

***TRAPS***
(x=1020, y=1840)
(x=1340, y=2100)

Note from Lee:
I use a slightly different tactic for these tunnel segments - I open the
door(s) and draw the Yuan-Ti back to the party in the 'safe' area, or
missile them to death from a distance. Once they're all dead, I can go
in and disarm traps at my leisure.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) The next move should be obvious-go through the southwest door at
(x=1100, y=2120), beyond which a great number of Yuan-ti lie. Host
of Yuan-ti to the south.. door they have to go through to get to us..
are you thinking what I'm thinking? If you're weighing your desire to
take a piss versus your laziness at having to get up to do so, then
you are! Also, this is a great place to use our lovely Web-bottleneck
trick. Be warned, however, that many of the baddies beyond brought bows,
so more than a few will be happy enough just sitting back taking pot-
shots. Throwing a Confusion at them won't help their aim any. Don't
expect the Web-strategy to be a fight-winner here, just use it to kill
the melee Yuan-ti before casting Haste (once the Web ends) rushing in,
and chopping the remaining archers down. Pay special attention to the
High Archer-he fires +2 Arrows and is quite lethal.. at least, if you
ignore him to chase other prey. Of your manifold means of murdering the
meanies, pick whichever one appeals to you the most, then loot the
room. The High Archer will drop as many as twenty Arrows +2 and the
Messenger of Sseth*1. If he drops fewer +2 Arrows, check your face;
they may be there.

Note: Do not waste Arrows +2, you will need them shortly against a
powerful foe. Yuan-ti can be killed just as well with normal arrows,
but the enemy at the end of this area requires +2 weapons to hit.

***ITEMS***
(x=750, y=2300) 569 gold, Arrows +1 x35
(x=900, y=2450) 239 gold, Arrows +2 x18
(x=1000, y=2600) 320 gold, Potions of Extra Healing x8

*1: This bow gives +1 damage and +2 THAC0, so it's not much of an
improvement over any old Composite Long Bow. Oh, and it's "extremely
fast", which means its speed factor is lower. Still, better than
nothing. If you found the Long Bow +2: Defender, you can laugh at this
weapon.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) You should be getting into the swing of things by now-another room
cleared, which means next we've got another hallway segment to tackle.
Again, I open the door at (x=1420, y=2000), and disarm the two traps
immediately beyond at (x=1520, y=2080) and (x=1540, y=2140). There's not
much chance you'll get bothered by any Yuan-ti whle doing this, although
there are three more Yuan-ti Elite archers at the end of the passage.
Once these two traps are destroyed, take the snakes down. There is
another trap at (x=2000, y=1880), but it shouldn't affect the fighting
any.

***TRAPS***
(x=1520, y=2080)
(x=1540, y=2140)
(x=2000, y=1880)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) When the tunnel snakes are smote (that sounds a little perverted,
doesn't it?) go through a door to the south (x=1900, y=2200). Beyond the
door are more Yuan-ti (surprise!) and some creatures known as Histachii,
which are significantly weaker than the Yuan-ti you have been fighting,
although they can disease you (which inflicts damage over time) and they
are immune to non-magical weapons. Continue east, then take the fork
north and dispatch two Yuan-ti Elite archers and steal their lovely
enchanted arrows. Backtrack and continue to the east, where you'll find
a torture chamber, and perhaps a few more Yuan-ti waiting to die. Loot
the room and activate the switch near one of the bookshelves
(x=3420, y=2000). Egad! A secret passage in an honest torture chamber?!

***ITEMS***
(x=2900, y=2200) Scroll of Ghost Shield
(x=3250, y=2000) Scroll of Dimension Door, Potion of Genius
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Backtrack to the west where you'll find our newly-uncovered secret
passage going east. Inside is The High Torturer (I'll bet they have a
High Shit-Shoveler down here somewhere, too.) The High Torturer suffers
from vision problems-which you think would affect his job security a
bit. Maybe they have him locked away here to keep him out of the way?
Anyways, you can pretend to be a student if you wish, but a fight is
inevitable. He's jointed by two melee Yuan-ti Elites. Cut them down and
loot The High Torturer for a Ring of Pain Amplification*1. Isn't that
something a torturee wears, and not a torturer? Maybe he's just holding
it until he's got another victim, or maybe he's just a masochist?

***HoF***
In Heart of Fury mode the High Torturer will be accompanied by a pair
of Yuan-ti Champions, instead of Yuan-ti Elites.

***ITEMS***
(x=3100, y=2500) 520 gold, Oil of the Serpent's Scales x2,
		 Moonstone Gem, Throwing Axe +2*2,
		 Scroll of Mirror Image*3

*1: This ring reduces your Slashing, Piercing, and Crushing resistances
by -20%. It's.. obviously not in your best interests to wear it. It's
also cursed, so unless you have access to Remove Curse, don't play with
it.
  ---
*2: A returning Throwing Axe. A good reason to specialize in Axes, I
think, as it allows one to wield a shield and have a ranged option. Of
course, this is an umimpressive option in Heart of Fury mode, although
it's great for more casual games.
  ---
*3: We could have bought one of these from Orrick, and really, there's
no reason not to. Foes aren't really able to take down your buffs with
True Sight in this game, and Mirror Image is an essential buff.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) It's time to go north through a door at (x=2000, y=1800), typical
tunnel tactics apply.. except this time, they're throwing you a curve-
ball. No Yuan-ti await you. Just two traps near the northern door
(x=2100, y=1350), (x=2000, y=1320). How dare they shake things up!
Well, if they're shaking things up, then so will I-we'll do the tunnel
AND its room in one Step! Go through the door at (x=1830, y=1500) and
scout ahead with a Thief. You will find a large group of Yuan-ti Priests
in this room, and it might be wise to get the spell-drop on them. I hit
them with a Confusion spell before charging with my party. There are
also three Yuan-ti Elite archers with the priests. Slaughter the snakes
and loot the throne for its meagre goodies.

***ITEMS***
(x=1200, y=850) Pearl Necklace, Studded Leather Armor +2

***TRAPS***
(x=2100, y=1350)
(x=2000, y=1320)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Backtrack into the hallway and go through the northern door at
(x=2000, y=1250), where you'll find.. another unguarded hallway segment.
Well, damn.. Disarm the traps at (x=1920, y=1020) and (x=2020, y=900)
before going through the southeastern door (x=2250, y=1050). A small
host of Yuan-ti and Histachii will come pouring out, in desperate need
of smiting. Continue to the southeast until you come across The High
Baptist. He-however-has his eyesight (a necessary function for somebody
who dunks others in water) and is quick to attack. Shoot him down before
he gets off any spells, kill his Histachii, and cure any diseases you
may have contracted. Having five Clerics really helps when you're
dealing with foes who can poison you or cause diseases.

***TRAPS***
(x=1920, y=1020)
(x=2020, y=900)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Return to the tunnels again and go through the doorway to the north-
east (x=2100, y=850). The next tunnel segment must be where all the
critters from the previous two tunnels fled. At the end of this tunnel
you'll find two lines of Yuan-ti guarding the door to the east-seven
Yuan-ti Elites and two Yuan-ti Priests. They also have plenty of traps
in front of-and among-them which should make melee seem like an
undesirable proposition. Worst of all, they know they're in a good
defensive spot, and they're not budging. How dare they remain wisely
stationary instead of persuing me to their demise! To deal with such
defiance I typically employ the following strategy-cast Invisibility
with your Fighter/Mage/Thief (on your Fighter/Mage/Thief) and safely
head up to the Yuan-ti and disarm all the traps, with them none the
wiser (be sure AI is off, less your character attack and blow your
cover). Now that the traps have been disarmed, hit them with a
pre-emptive spell assault, including spells like Confusion, Slow, or
good old Web. Once done, rush up and smite them.

***TRAPS***
(x=2470, y=700)
(x=2500, y=800)
(x=2530, y=700)
(x=2600, y=900)
(x=2700, y=800)
(x=2780, y=700)

Note from Lee:
I don't know why, but for me they did chase me back into the room and
allowed me to slaughter them all in the doorway. No spell-buffing or
offensive magic required...
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Well, that was fun. One last room to explore before we see what lies
beyond the door those Yuan-ti were so fervently guarding. Go through the
door to the north (x=2300, y=600) and smite a smattering of Yuan-ti.
I dare say we've found the kitchen. Go through the door to the west
(x=1400, y=400) and annhilate a few more Yuan-ti and claim the loot in
the chests as your own.

(x=1350, y=400) 76 gold, Potion of Freedom, ~The Red Knight's Shield*1
		(3rd play: The Bitch Queen's Envoy*2)
(x=1000, y=300) Potion of Fortitude, 110 gold.
(x=1050, y=250) Potion of Healing x3, Baleful Mail*3
*1: A +3 Medium Shield. It doesn't give any bonuses versus Missile
Weapons, but it's base +4 bonus to Armor Class still makes the best
shield we've seen by far. I put it on my party leader to boost his
Armor Class to a hefty -12. I'm stacking the deck on purpose.
  ---
*2: This shield is inferior to the Red Knights' Shield, but still
superior to anything else you've found.
  ---
*3: Essentially +2 Chain Mail Armor that protects from a host of common
mind-affecting effects, such as Dire Charm, Charm Person, Confusion,
Command, and Rigid Thinking. Of course, since it can't be worn by good
characters, it won't find a home on my party. On the bright side, it
sold for 5700 gold.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Now you're all ready to head east into the final room of this area..
but before you do, I highly suggest you go to town, sell off any loot
you may have found, and generally make space in your inventory. The
most prolific fight of the game thus far awaits beyond this door. Make
sure  everybody has a +2 or better weapon. Everybody that needs to be
attacking, anyways. Syrenil readies some of those Arrows +2. My multi-
class party's stats are as follows at the moment:

Everybody needs a +2 weapon in order to be able to meaningfully
contribute to the fight ahead.. which means my 4th and 5th characters
are simply out of luck. Before I go through the door to the east
(x=2750, y=700) I cast Invisibility on Syrenil-we need to level the
field a bit before we charge on in. Open the door, head east, and disarm
the traps at (x=3000, y=600), (x=3200, y=650), and (x=3200, y=800).
Syrenil retreats and rejoins my party in the hallway outside of the
door. Now I  buff my party as much as I can-Draw Upon Holy Might,
Prayer, Recitation, Bless, Haste, and personal buffs like Blur and
Mirror Image, with what characters who have them. These buffs lower the
THAC0s of my entire party by a solid four points-not counting the
additional bonuses of having higher Strength, Dexterity, and Constiution
that my Clerics also recieve.

Now that I'm buffed, I take Ilnathias and lead him into the room, with
the rest of my party about half a screen behind him. He'll talk to the
'Odd Little Girl' and, after some banter, she'll turn into Yxunomei-a
Marilith. The reason I've been stacking his Armor Class is simple-he's
going to lead the charge against Yxunomei. My other four Clerics cast
Silence 15' Radius on/near the Yuan-ti behind Yxunomei, then Amirule and
Kaelinalia join the fray. Nauzhir and Eraithul cast more spells or
engage some of the Yuan-ti, while Syrenil casts Confusion, then starts
shooting Yxunomei with Arrows +2. If the Yuan-ti Priests get any spells
off, they'll typically target Ilnathias, and if he's the only one who
is targeted by Dispel Magic, Hold Person, or other debuffs, we're gold.
He's immune to the latter, and can endure the former better. Yxunomei
is also fond of casting Cloudkill, but by now we should have leveled
past it being fatal, although it can still be a nuisance. Yxunomei
should go down in 4-5 rounds or so, and once she does, mop up her
Yuan-ti. Ilnathias and Kaelinalia get bruised up a bit (down to 39
Hit Points, the both of them) but nobody else is injured. All in all,
it's a decent victory for a party that is still full of understudies.

Once all the snakes are dead, loot the room and leave. You're done in
Dragon's Eye, and for the first time in the game you've actually
succeessfully accomplished a task that Arundel has given you. Huzzah!
It's time to return to Kuldahar and let the good news flow.

***HoF***
I can honestly say I was disappointed with this battle in Heart of Fury
mode. My tactics? I Equipped my Fighter/Mage/Thief with Arrows +2 and
cast Haste on the party. I then simply waltzed in and smote her. The
only difference in this fight is that some Yuan-ti Mages appear behind
you once you've caught Yxunomei's attention. You can simply double-back,
dispatch them with the full might of your Heart of Fury party, and deal
with Yxunomei however you please. Actually using Heart of Fury tactics
like Symbol of Hopelessness and Tenser's would make this even more
laughable.

Note from Lee:
I move the party into the northwest corner of the "room" (the hallway
segment) and engage with just the party leader. Once the conversation
is thru, I run back to the party and wait - Yxunomei will come into the
room and actually be in front of her minions. Bad move bitch... Once
she's dead, I go immediately after the Yuan-Ti Mages that show up (who
are in front of the party, thanks to my position in the hallway), then
mop up the rest... I did this without spell-buffing, but I really don't
recommend trying it without buffs unless/until you've done this fight a
few times and know what to expect.

*1: This item, like all great Armor Class boosting gear, goes on my
party leader. The trickle-down effect works for Armor Class in Icewind
Dale.. unlike the trickle-down effect in the American economy. Unlike
the people with all the money in America, in Icewind Dale the person
with all the armor takes all the hits. They don't hide their excessive
Armor Class in off-shore bank accounts and let the rest of the group
get the shit kicked out of them.

Kuldahar (AR2100)
o======================================================================o
13) When you get back, you'll notice things are amiss. Maybe it's the
air? Maybe it's the giant Orogs all over the place? Probably the Orogs.
Kill them on your way to Arundel's. After the first bit of dialogue,
follow Arundel upstairs to trigger the second part. Story unfolds, and
you are given the quest to find Larrel in the Severed Hand. He'll leave
behind a Staff of Nature's Wrath*1. It sells for a bit, if nothing else.
Speaking of which, be sure to sell off all the junk you have accumlated,
buy spell scrolls as they interest you (having a Mage who can cast
Haste, Slow, Confusion, and Dispel Magic will put you in good shape for
a while.)

*1: In all the time it took Arundel to become an Arch Druid, the best
weapon he was able to get his hands on was this? It's a +1 Quarter Staff
that allows you to cast Entangle or Flame Strike. It's probably better
off as kindling, but at least it's self-lighting.

Arundel is dead, and let's be honest-our track-record thus far has been
somewhat spotty. We set out from Easthaven as humble mercenaries looking
to tag along and earn some cash, and now we're the sole survivors of our
expedition, involved in some cosmic struggle between two evil beings of
immense power. We are all that stands between Kuldahar and oblivion.
Dramatic, huh? We're lost without Arundel to tell us where to go,
however, so we need to find this Larrel and hope the Heartstone Gem
points us in the right direction.

The Severed Hand, Exterior (AR5000)

Sequence of Events:						{WLK012}
		1) Larrel Versus Squirrel
		2) Shadows in the Severed Hand
		3) Traps, Bottlenecks, and Baddies
		4) Two Handed Sword Ambush
		5) Another Ambush

1) Five days and one chapter introduction later and here we are. Larrel
makes an appearance, accuses a Squirrel of treachery before launching a
Fireball at it, and wanders off muttering to himself. That looks
promising. There's not much else to do but enter the Severed Hand
(x=300, y=200).

***ITEM FISHING***
More item fishing for you! There's going to be a lot of it here, and
much of it can be quite lucrative. The first thing I should point out is
that on the currently unreachable eastern half of (AR5001) you can find
one of the best suits of armor in the game-Shadowed Plate Mail. A
Severed Soul will randomly drop one shadowed item (another interesting
drop is the Shadowed Robe). The bad news? Since you have to go through
the western half of (AR5001) and through several other areas before you
can circle back around to reach the eastern half of (AR5001), the item
will be locked well before you have a chance to find out what it is.
Being such a pain in the ass, you're better off just ignoring it, taking
what you get, and moving on. There are other suits of armor that are
just as good and-more importantly-static drops. Anyways, enough teasing
you about loot drops that you might not get, to focus on items that can
reasonably be fished for. On the first level of the Severed Hand you can
score some pretty sweet Two Handed Swords. Kresselack's is beyond out-
dated by now. There are two swords that are worth keeping an eye out
for, either the Two Handed Sword +2: Hammering, or the Two Handed
Sword +2: Defender. The former has a chance to stun, while the latter
does all the good things we've come to expect from Defender weapons-
bonus to Armor Class and resistances. Both can be found at
(x=450, y=1550).

The Severed Hand, Level 1 (West) (AR5001)
o======================================================================o
2) Once inside you'll be attacked by Shadowed Orcs.. which are like
normal Orcs, but stronger and undead. They come in a number of
varieties-Orc Grunts, Orc Archers, Orc Shaman, Goblin Grunts, Goblin
Archers, Goblin Marskmen.. all Shadowed, of course. Anyways, this fight
shouldn't pose much of a problem to you, just keep an eye on your party
members and make sure they don't run into an ambush or over traps. A
fair warning now-pretty much everything in this place is undead, which
means no enchantment spells. You can just forget about Confusion,
Emotion, and such spells. Melee is king in this dungeon (or rather,
physical damage). The best your Mages can do here is spell-buff.. but
considering how much Haste improves our damage out-put, it's not an
unworthy task. Also.. all our Mages can also fight! No dead weight in
multi-class land.

***HOF***
Almost everything in this place is undead-seriously, for the rest of
this Chapter, Invisosmite is the only tactic you'll need. There are a
few times where you'll get forced into a fight upon reaching a new
level, but for the most part, if you keep your party invisible and your
'Turn Undead' ability active on your Clerics, you'll be able to just
walk through this place. Life is good when you've got Invisosmite on
your side. I will record normal tactics for those of you who do not
have Invisosmite capabilities (how could you NOT have a Cleric?), or
more likely, for those of you who feel that the tactic is cheap (if it
plays, it stays, for me), and I will not keep reminding you about
Invisosmite-you know the drill by now-just remember that in lieu of
normal tactics.. Invisosmite!

Note from Lee:
Upon entering, I cast a Web at (x=1180, y=1580), another Web at
(x=970, y=1500), and a Sleep on the asshole at (x=850, y=1380). This
effectively removes all resistance and allows me to pick off the various
enemies with missile fire.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) From the entrance, head south, where you can pass over some rubble
and into a room guarded by three traps (locations below). In this room
are more Orcs who would love to do nothing more than bottleneck you in
the entrance to the room. Too bad they're full of weak sauce. Smite
them and head into the room they were guarding-there are a few archers
and an Orc Shaman, but nothing that should seriously trouble you. Ignore
the stairs at (x=1600, y=2050) and loot the urn at (x=1250, y=1820)
before heading into the room to the west.

***ITEMS***
(x=1250, y=1820) Chyrosberyl Gem, Potion of Heroism

***TRAPS***
(x=1300, y=1730)
(x=1300, y=1690)
(x=1250, y=1670)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Some puny Goblins will try to halt your entry into this room-laugh at
them and continue around to the northwest. When you approach the
lootable rubble at (x=450, y=1550) you'll be ambushed by a band of Orcs,
who sneakily appear from nowhere. This group includes two Orc Shaman,
Orc Archers, Orc Grunts, and two Shadowed Ogres who will come from the
north. You can, of course, trigger this 'ambush' with a sneaking or
invisible character, and then simply fight the battle normally. This
advice should be common sense by now, but be sure to focus on the stupid
Shaman, first. You don't need them throwing out Hold Person spells. Be
sure to loot the rubble at (x=450, y=1550), as it contains some random-
and often rather valuable-loot.

***ITEMS***
(x=450, y=1550)	~Two Handed Sword +2: Hammering*1
		(6th Play: Battle Axe +2)
		(7th Play: Two Handed Sword +2: Defender*2)
(x=800, y=1600) 69 gold

*1: A +2 Two Handed Sword with a chance to stun. Definately an upgrade
over Kresselack's.
  ---
*2: We know how awesome Defender weapons are, and this is no exception.
It's a +2 Two Handed Sword that gives a +1 bonus to Armor Class and a
+10% bonus to Slashing Resistance. Fantastic.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) From the ambush room continue north until you run across another pack
of Orcs-an Orc Shaman leading a handful of Orc Archers. If all this
seems painfully easy to you now.. it's because it is. Really, these Orcs
and Goblins are chumps. Head east a bit and you'll find some Goblins
(Archers and Grunts) to the Southwest, along the northern part of
the room where we entered. Once all the shadowed beasties are dead,
find the ramp up at (x=1200, y=500)

***ITEMS***
(x=920, y=2050) Potion of Extra Healing, Waterstar Gem,
		Elixer of Health
(x=800, y=650) Scroll of Emotion: Hopelessness*1
(x=620, y=950) 67 gold, Potion of Healing

***ITEM FISHING***
Another great weapon lies on the next level, and it's fairly easy to
get, too. At (x=1550, y=400) you have a chance to score a Sanctified
Morning Star +3. It's a Mace-proficiency weapon with a +3 enhancement
that adds some bonus Cleric spells.. what more could you ask for? When
you approach the container where this mace is.. uh.. contained, you'll
trigger an ambush. Be sure to use Invisibility.

*1: This is another great 4th-level debuff for the Mage, although it's
inferior to Confusion.

The Severed Hand, Level 2 (West) (AR5002)
o======================================================================o
6) Once you reach this level, cast Invisibility on a character (or
sneak) and head south to reach the circular walkway connecting the rooms
of the level to the central tree-stairs. Get used to the layout-we'll
be going up and down this stupid tower quite a bit in the next couple
of Steps.. Anyways, once outside the room with the ramp, head east,
then north into another room. Surprise! Ambush. Orc Shaman, Goblin
Warriors, Goblin Marksmen.. all standing around stupidly with nothing
to attack. With the rest of your party, you can now exit the ramp
room and launch a little ambush of your own-as many Goblins appeared
in the hallway to the south (as well as in the room where your sneaky
character is). Mop up the opposition, working your way to the room
where you triggered the ambush. Once everything is dead, do be sure
to loot the rubble, as the debris at (x=1550, y=400) tends to drop
rather good Morning Stars. Also, there's a chance that One of the
Orc Shaman will drop a Ring of Dwarven Bone*1, for what little that's
worth.

***ITEMS***
(x=1550, y=400) ~Sanctified Morning Star +3*2
		(3rd Play: Morning Star of Lesser Phasing*3)
(x=1830, y=400) 119 gold, Potion of Agility, Potion of Stone Form,
		Scroll of Animate Dead

*1: This ring gives its wearer +1 Strength (up to a maximum of 18/00).
It can't be worn by good characters, however, and considering that this
is only a marginal increase over what I already have, it's not worth
losing out on the Shimmering Sash.
  ---
*2: One of the better Mace-proficiency drops in the game, it's a +3
Morning Star that allows the wielder to memorize two additional 1st
level Cleric spells. It's nowhere near as good as the Morning Star +4:
Defender, but it's a good weapon to use in the meantime.
  ---
*3: A +2 Morning Star that has a +15% chance to phase an enemy, and a
+25% chance to deal 1d3 cold damage. I'd rather have the Sanctified
Morning Star +3.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Head south around the outer hallway circling the level. You'll
probably be provoked by some Goblins and an Orc Shaman near a ramp
at (x=500, y=900). Smite them and continue until you find a 'Shadowed
Goblin Trainer' to the west at (x=500, y=1450). He's got some Goblin
buddies to deal with, and he'll also summon up a horde of Shadow Worgs,
in case you weren't sick of ambushes already. When the trainer dies,
he'll leave behind the Jester's Bag of Holding*1. Emphasis more on the
Jester's, less on the Bag of Holding, so don't get too excited.

*1: A minorly useful accessory that produces various items. Mostly junk,
but sometimes you can get magical arrows and whatnot. For more detailed
information, go see [MSC002]. If you plan to have a devoted archer in
your party, this item is the only way to keep yourself well-stocked in
magical ammunition.. well, the only legitimate way. You'll just have
to save/load farm Arrows +1.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) From the room where you encountered the Shadowed Goblin Trainer head
south into another room-this one is also cluttered with Goblins that
didn't figure out how to die correctly the first time. Give them proper
instruction and see that it sticks this time. There are bound to be
stragglers to the west-plenty of Marksmen, which are, next to Shaman and
their Hold Person spells, perhaps the most dangerous of the Orcs and
Goblins here.. which isn't saying much. If you would have taken the
stairs up (instead of the ramp) to reach this level, you arrive at
(x=1700, y=2100). It's easier to reach that lovely Sanctified Morning
Star +3 from the ramp, however. Again, we have two options for pursuing
the next level-stairs at (x=1400, y=1300), and a ramp at (x=500, y=900).
Both paths are somewhat annoying, as they put us under archer fire,
but the ramp this time leads to an ancillary little area where we can
pick up some loot, whereas the stairs actually advance us through the
level.. so let's go climb that ramp, shall we?

***ITEMS***
(x=900, y=1760) Potion of Healing, Potion of Genius,
		Scroll of Emotion: Courage*1

*1: This spell gives a bonus of +1 THAC0, +3 damage, and +5 temporary
Hit Points. Better yet, it has a range of 10 feet and lasts 5 turns.
That is certainly long enough to last any encounter. I find it inferior
to Emotion: Hope, but since the two stack with each other (and not
with themselves), for the biggest fights it's worth keeping one of each
prepared.

***ITEM FISHING***
The best items that can be fished for next level occurs up the stairs,
not the ramp. Some undead have a chance to drop a variety of items,
and over at (x=600, y=1250) you can fish for a shield. The game is
usually pretty generous about dropping a Shield of the Hand, which is
the best item I've pulled out of the rubble there, and is the second
best shield you could have found by now (and I have no shortage of
characters looking for a shield). If you do decide to go after it,
you'll need to do Steps #10 and #11 first, then backtrack to do Step #9.
I don't usually bother worrying about the other items I can get from
the undead-they're not too great, especially since the Serrated Bone
Blade is arguably not any better than the Two Handed Swords we were
able to find back on level one.

The Severed Hand, Level 3 (Exterior) (AR5003)
o======================================================================o
9) As I indicated, there are Goblin Marksmen on the exterior ring and
the interior ring of this level, so either way you went up, you'd be
under fire by little yellow assholes. On softer difficulties, you can
simply park a sturdy Fighter in the line of fire while your archer
greets their archers with the universal hello of arrows through the
face. On Heart of Fury mode, however, it's less trouble to simply go up
either the ramp or the stairs, clear out the archers, then go hit the
other side. After all, WE don't have infinite ammo like some rat-
bastard computer does. From the ramp head east and dispatch a handful of
Goblins. Continue east and you should notice a passage to the south.
Sneak/cast Invisibility on a character and send them out into the
exterior ring of this level, circling around counter-clockwise until
you approach some treasure at (x=700, y=980), where you'll be ambushed
yet again by two Orc Shaman, a host of Orc Grunts, and two Ogres. One
Ogre may drop the axe Guktok's Chopper*1, and an Orc Shaman might drop
the Ring of Dwarven Bone if it wasn't dropped earlier. Grab the loot
they were guarding, then head back down the ramp (x=800, y=600).

***ITEMS***
(x=700, y=980) Misery's Herald*2

*1: A +2 Battle Axe, +4 vs. Dwarves. You really won't be fighting
Dwarves in this game (I struggle to think of any such fights, in fact),
so if a +2 Battle Axe doesn't sell you.. well, then sell this.
  ---
*2: Misery's Herald is a +3 Flail, +4 versus Elves, which will come in
handy very shortly. It also has a 10% chance to inflict Horror when it
hits as well. It's a decent weapon for this stage of the game.

The Severed Hand, Level 3 (Interior) (AR5003)
o======================================================================o
10) Take the stairs on level two (x=1400, y=1300) up to level three to
reach the interior ring of the level. If you didn't deal with the Goblin
Marksmen earlier.. well, they're right in front of you now. Avoid the
paths leading to the exterior of the level for now and just do a sweep
of the area, smiting any Goblins you come across. Once done, regroup at
the stairs. We want to go southwest first, but a trio of oddly-shaped
traps blocks our progress. Disarm them, and get ready to trigger yet
another freaking ambush.

***TRAPS***
(x=930, y=1450)
(x=980, y=1490)
(x=1040, y=1500)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) After the traps have been dealt with, take your sneaky-type
character (or expend another Invisibility) and cross the bridge to
the Southwest. Head up clockwise to find some rubble at
(x=600, y=1250). When you get near it, the undead beehive will burst,
and we'll be rushed by Armored Skeletons (big melee types) and a Burning
Skeleton (they like to lob fireball-type effects at you, and should
be given some serious smite-priority). Pulverize the undead, then claim
the treasure they were rattling their bones about.. typically some kind
of shield or another.

***HoF***
The Armored Skeletons and Bladed Skeletons can be pretty rough in melee,
but the Burning Skeletons are the real threat, able to deal scores of
damage to multiple party members at once. Buffing with Resist Fire/Cold
and Entropy Shield should make all our melee characters immune to them,
however. Also be sure to take out Shattered Souls with some priority.
They don't do excessive damage, but their ability to hit unerringly is
much more concerning than any enemy that has to actually make a to hit
roll.

***ITEMS***
(x=600, y=1250) ~Great Shield +3*1
		(4th Play: Shield of the Hand*2)
		(6th Play: Small Shield +1. The game obviously hates me
		on this play-through)

*1: This is a +4 Armor Class shield with a number of 15% resistances.
Unfortunately it imposes a -2 THAC0 penalty. All things considered,
I'd rather fish for a better shield, or just ignore this one. Better
shields will be coming that don't negatively impact our combat
potential.
  ---
*2: This shield has a respectable +3 bonus to Armor Class, with an
additional +1 bonus vs. Missile Weapons. It's the second best shield
we've found so far, and it goes to my 2nd-rank character (Amirule) as a
result. She passes down the Reinforced Large shield +1, and so on...
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Now that we've secured our position on this level a bit (and
perhaps plucked a decent new shield out of the rubble), it's time to
explore this area counter-clockwise. Stay along the southern edge of
the area and head east. At about six o'clock you'll find some more
Armored Skeletons, a Burning Skeleton, and a Bladed Skeleton (a meaner
melee baddy). The fireball-chucker still takes priority, if you can
manage it. North of here are some stairs (x=1300, y=1600), which you
should do your best to ignore for now.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) Continue counter-clockwise until you come to a door at about
(x=2400, y=1700). Politely ask the magical door fairy to open the door
for you, and when nothing happens, just do it yourself (you can still
pretend magical fairies heard you and helped open the door, if you
wish.) Beyond the door-a room! Within the room-more undead! Four Bladed
Skeletons, not too bad. Let them come out to you, then smash them. Be
wary walking through the door-pathfinding likes to send your characters
on a round-about route which will inevitably lead them over traps. Once
you're safely inside the room, explore to the northwest to find an
elevator (x=2000, y=1400). We'll be using it soon enough, but for now,
content yourself with disarming another trio of traps just west of the
elevator.

***TRAPS***
(x=1920, y=1350)
(x=1900, y=1390)
(x=1900, y=1440)

Note from Lee:
The "magical door fairy"... I literally had to stop for the better part
of a minute and wait to stop laughing at this.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
14) Open another door (x=2600, y=1450) and scout ahead if you have the
desire. Along the northern end of the room beyond you'll encounter a
Burning Skeleton-assholishly placed in front so as to blast you with
a fireball, a pair of Shattered Souls (immune to non-magical weapons,
uses Larloch's Minor Drain constantly, either to damage you, or to heal
other undead), three Bladed Skeletons, and a Serrated Skeleton-a unique
Bladed Skeleton. I lead with Ilnathias, who has protected himself with
Protection from Fire (a third-level Cleric spell). He charges the
Burning Skeleton and takes only minimal damage from it. Once engaged,
the rest of my party shows up. The Serrated Skeleton will drop some
random goodies for us, as follows:

(1st Play: Bone Talisman*1)
(4th Play: Bone Marrow Belt*2)
(6th Play: Serrated Bone Blade*3)
(7th Play: Bone Kris of Black Ichor*4)

*1: This sorry little amulet allows the wearer to cast Vampire Touch
five times. I wipe my ass with this thing.
  ---
*2: +1 Armor Class, -2 Charisma, 50% Slashing Resistance, -15% Crushing
Resistance. This belt definitely can come in handy against the right
foes. It's another item that can't be used by good characters, and I
still maintain that the Shimmering Sash is superior.
  ---
*3: A Two-Handed Sword +3 is nothing to balk at, especially when it
has a 20% chance to do +1d10 cold damage. Maybe the game doesn't hate
me on this play-through, after all.
  ---
*4: A +2 Dagger that has a 20% chance to poison critters hit by it.

***ITEM FISHING***
I feel silly even mentioning this, but you can fish for some Short
Swords on the next level at (x=2650, y=1850). Short Swords are not
spectacular weapons in Icewind Dale, and these ones are nothing to get
excited about.

The Severed Hand, Level 2 (East) (AR5002)
o======================================================================o
15) Return to the smaller room to the south and hop on the elevator at
(x=2000, y=1400). Once you reach the eastern end of level two, you'll
find yourself under attack by some Armored Skeletons and Shattered
Souls. Try to keep a leash on your characters and deal with the foes
immediately at hand, as there are several more Shattered Souls to the
east that aren't initially involved in the fight, and the fewer of them
you have pelting you with Larloch's, the better. Once the first group of
foes are dead, bring your message of smite to the east. Loot the
furniture and yawn at the Short Swords therein. North of the elevator
you'll find a bridge leading to some stairs down (x=1800, y=1300), and
north still you'll find a room with more baddies to pound. Once you're
done ruining some undead, head down the stairs.

***ITEMS***
(x=2650, y=1850) ~Some Lesser God's Promise*1
		 (3rd Play: Short Sword of Action +2*2)

*1: A +2 Short Sword that has a 5% chance to heal the wieder for 1d6
damage.
  ---
*2: This Short Sword does little besides its +2 enhancement bonus-it
adds one measely point to Dexterity.

***ITEM FISHING***
Down here is where you can finally get a shot at the Shadowed gear I
mentioned earlier. If you're lucky, you'll score some Shadowed Plate
Mail or a Shadowed Robe. If not.. well, the drop was locked when you
first entered this level. Although the variability in the quality of
the drops here are very, very high, I don't suggest fishing for better
gear here. First, it's a pain in the ass to make 'runs' through the
several area transitions enroute to this drop. Second, there are plenty
of other drops along the way that are worth fishing for-and not worth
negating just because of a bad drop here. In any event, the Shadowed
items are dropped by a 'Severed Soul', a unique Shattered Soul that is
otherwise unremarkable. There's also a variable Cross Bow loot at
(x=2650, y=1150) which, again, is already locked.

The Severed Hand, Level 1 (East) (AR5001)
o======================================================================o
16) As soon as you enter this level, you'll be pestered by several
Bladed Skeletons and a Severed Soul. The latter is noteworthy solely
because it can drop two great pieces of armor-not just for this point
in the game, but armor that you could very well be wearing until the
end of the game. First is Shadowed Plate Mail-it's supposed to be
Plate Mail with a 'Blur' effect on it (at least, according to its
description.) Fortunately, however, instead of just having the armor
apply Blur, they compensate by making it ordinary Plate Mail Armor..
with a three point Armor Class bonus. Essentially, it counts as Plate
Mail +3-with a base Armor Class of 0, it's one of the more protective
suits of armor in the game. The second of these great bits of armor you
can (possibly) get is the Shadowed Robe, which gives its wearer an
Armor Class of four and 15% Magic Resistance. Certainly better than
the Necromancer's Robes Presio dropped us. All the junk this Severed
Soul has dropped me can be found at the end of this paragraph. After
dispatching our welcoming party (and celebrating/lamenting the Severed
Soul's drop) head east, where you'll find two rooms crawling with
Bladed Skeletons and Shattered Souls.

(1st Play: Shadowed Cloak*1)
(3rd Play: Shadowed Plate Mail Armor*2)
(5th Play: Shadowed Robe*3)
(6th Play: Shadowed Boots*4)

***ITEMS***
(x=2650, y=1150) ~Heavy Crossbow of Accuracy*5
		 (6th Play: Light Crossbow of Speed*6)
		 (7th Play: Light Crossbow of Defense*7)

*1: This cloak gives you stealth +10%. It goes on Syrenil, the only
character in my party who can wear it.
  ---
*2: Too bad I didn't get this armor in one of the first play throughs.
If you are lucky enough to get your hands on this armor.. it's better
than the Mythril Field Plate +2 you'll find later. In fact.. I'll go so
far as to say this is the best armor in the game. Bathed-In-Blood has a
better Armor Class, but it's only one point better, and the +3 AC vs.
missiles that this armor gives more than makes up for it.
  ---
*3: Robes with an Armor Class of four (one point worse than Plate Mail)
and +15% Magic Resistance. In the entire game, only the Robe of the
Watcher is better.
  ---
*4: Boots that give a +1 bonus to Armor Class and +15% to Move Silently
aren't bad (especially not for Syrenil), but I can't help but wish I
had found the armor or robes instead.
  ---
*5: This bow gives +2 damage and +7 THAC0. Normally, I'm crazy about the
THAC0, but I already have a +4 damage +4 THAC0 bow. The bottom line is
the old bow gives an extra attack around. I'd say another attack gives
me an extra chance to hit each round, and that's just fine. We'll find
more of these as a guaranteed drops later, so there's no need to fish
for it here.
  ---
*6: A fairly nice little crossbow, it's not quite what I'm looking for,
but with its +2 damage and +4 THAC0, and it's two attacks per round,
it's better than the Heavy Crossbow of Accuracy that drops here.
  ---
*7: At +4 THAC0, +2 Damage, +1 Armor Class, and +10% Missile Resistance,
it's the best Light Cross Bow we've found all game.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
17) Leave the northern of the two rooms east of the stairs and explore
to the north to find some more undead. Kill them and loot the debris
at (x=2500, y=850) to find a 'Piece of Broken Machinery'. This seems
kind of questy, doesn't it? It should, and it is. Hold on to it. Now,
believe it or not we're done with the main tower portion of the Severed
Hand. Unfortunately for us, this place was built by Elves, so they've
got towers branching off their freakin' towers. Head back up the stairs
(x=1700, y=1350) to level two, then take the elevator (x=2100, y=1500)
up to level three, and finally take the stairs (x=1300, y=1600) up to
level four.

***ITEMS***
(x=2500, y=850) Piece of Broken Machinery*1

*1: A quest item you'll need. Keep it in your inventory at all times.
This is the first of four pieces.

The Severed Hand, Level 4 (AR5004)
o======================================================================o
1) This area is fairly tame, and it seems to be as far as the Orcs and
Goblins advanced within the Hand. Everything below us-Orcs and Goblins-
everything above us-Elves. Unlike the 'no man's land' between two
forces, however, this level is.. well, safe. It seems the bonds of
death have frozen this conflict in stasis. There are a number of NPCs
to talk to here, but first, the layout of the level. This level, like
all the lower levels aspired to be, consists of an inner ring. A huge
tree dominates the center of the level, where stairs and the elevator
can be found. Along the outside of the level are rooms, connected by
the circular hallway. Unlike the lower levels, however, this level is
fairly intact, and at each cardinal direction you'll find stairs leading
to a tower, each named after a member of the Elven pantheon.. well,
technically there are two towers to the north, but since Sehanine Tower
doesn't exist anymore, we'll just consider north as being the sole
province of Corellon Tower, while Sheverash Tower is to the east, to the
south you'll find Solonor Tower, and to the west lies Labelas Tower.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) From the stairs where you arrived, head southwest and open a door
at (x=850, y=1380). In the room beyond you'll find what apparently used
to be a fest-hall, where some Shadowed Elves can be found drinking and
carrying on.. at least, until you enter to the room. You can also find
Telanis, an Elven Bard (x=380, y=1500).. or rather, singer EXTRAORDINARE,
MASTER of the eight-string mandolin... and so forth. Get him to sing you
some songs and he'll tell you a tale about the Dwarves and the Elves,
their alliance against the 'dark horde', and the eventual falling out of
the two sides when Orcs showed up with Dwarven-forged weapons. He'll also
sing about Larrel, who apparently founded the  Hand. Yay... backstory. If
only we could find somebody who would tell us the story without resorting
to prose. Loot and leave.

***ITEMS***
(x=700, y=1300) Potion of Healing, Potion of Clarity
(x=920, y=1500) Potion of Insight, Potion of Insulation
(x=1300, y=1670) Potion of Absorption, Potion of Mind Focusing
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Explore counter-clockwise. Through the door at (x=1750, y=1600) you
can find another, seedier, and yet somehow less interesting watering
hole. Past it, there's a door at (x=2050, y=950), beyond which you'll
find Sehriya (x=2270, y=820), still diligently running this little inn
and waiting in vain for her mother. She seems oblivious to the fact that
she's dead, much less the fact that her mother is never coming back.
This is fortunate for us, as she'll let us rest here. Undead don't need
their creature comforts, but we sure do!

***ITEMS***
(x=2220, y=950) 110 gold, Scroll of Cone of Cold*1, Potion of Healing,
		Potion of Cold Resistance

*1: A fair offensive spell, you probably don't have anything better to
fill up your 5th level spell slots with. Like with Fireball, you have to
be careful of friendly fire.. Or rather, friendly ice.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Continue around the level counter-clockwise and open another door at
(x=1470, y=700), beyond which you can find a room with a lootable table
(x=1300, y=380). Outside the room you'll find Lethias (x=1270, y=800),
a rather touchy Elven spirit. Talk to him if you wish, but don't be
rude, and don't say you're here to loot the Hand, or he'll attack. Why
is that a bad thing? Well, because he's freakin' invincible. Seriously,
he doesn't die. Pick dialogue option #1 repeatedly and he will tell you,
finally, what happened in the Hand of the Seldarine. Long story short-
the Elves got their asses kicked, and as a final fall-back plan they
decided to unleash the combined powers of their stored artifacts to
kill as many invaders as possible and, in the same stroke, deny them
the use of said artifacts. The only other thing of interest he'll tell
you is that Larrel had locked himself atop Labelas Tower.

***ITEMS***
(x=1300, y=380) Scroll of Emotion: Hope*1, Potion of Clarity,
		Berduskan Black Brew, Potion of Strength

*1: Another nice emotion spell, this one gives +2 THAC0, damage, and
saves. I'd suggest keeping this spell handy for big fights as well, to
be used in tandem with Emotion: Courage. It push comes to shove,
however, I'd prefer this spell over Emotion: Courage.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) To the west you'll find the door (x=900, y=950) leading to the final
room to explore. In the room beyond you'll find Lehland (x=660, y=820),
who fancies himself a merchant. He, too, doesn't seem to understand
that he is quite dead, and that most of his merchandise has long since
been ruined. He'll tell you of the various towers which we'll be
exploring shortly, and he does have a few things to sell-containers and
ammunition, mainly.

Labelas Tower, Level 1 (AR5101)
o======================================================================o
6) Now, we've come here seeking Larrel, right? So it only makes sense
that we give Labelas Tower a try first. It's the western tower, the
one nearest to the stairs and, conveniently enough, our present
location. So why not give it a look-see? Head west and exit the area
at (x=200, y=1200). What you'll find beyond is not encouraging. Larrel
has apparently blown up the tower, and he is in the middle of cackling
about it Yoda-style when you enter. Well, this path is a bust.

Solonor Tower, Level 1 (AR5201)
o======================================================================o
7) Head back to the fourth level of the Hand (x=200, y=800) and enter
Solonor Tower (x=1500, y=2000). In this level you'll find Denaini
wandering about. Talk to her, and don't pick a fight-it's not lucrative
in the long run (but at least she CAN be killed, unlike Lethias.) She'll
tell you some more about Larrel and the fall of the Hand. Apparently
Solonor Tower-or at least this level of it-was a shrine to the Elven
gods, where the Elves here spent their free time praying and whatnot.
Seems to me that somebody should have spent less time praying, and more
time fortifying. Anyways, we can, then, assume that this is the priest's
tower, and we should be prepared to deal with Clerics. Remember, THEY
can still use mind-affecting spells on us, even if WE can't use them.
She'll also mention needing some holy water to purify the pools, and
will also ask us to knock off her fellow priests in the tower above.
Apparently Larrel cast some Mythal in a last-ditch effort to save the
Hand, and the result are the Shadowed undead that still lurk its halls-
Elves and Orcs (and Goblins and Ogres) alike. Most went mad due to the
effects of the Mythal, hence, we'll be fighting hosts of barmy Elves.
Mythals.. sounds like the kind of stuff that Orrick would be interested
in, no? Yep, we've got plenty of quests to keep in mind. Anyhow, the
stairs to level two are at (x=300, y=900).

***ITEM FISHING***
Next level you can fish for enchanted War Hammers of various quality.
Smash the Clerics and Acolytes guarding the level and loot the container
at (x=800, y=550) for a shot at these weapons. The best of them do not
compare well to the Sanctified Morning Star +3, but the War Hammer of
Sparks +2 is still a pretty good weapon in its own right.

Solonor Tower, Level 2 (AR5202)
o======================================================================o
8) On this level youll find groups of hostile Elven Clerics and Elven
Acolytes. The former are actually dangerous, as they'll cast spells,
while the latter are weak melee types. Don't be surprised if they throw
Mental Domination, Cloak of Fear, Rigid Thinking, and Miscast Magic at
you, and they will also buff their allies with spells like Prayer and
Recitation. They should thus be given special priority for arrow-face-
interation, and of course, Silence 15' Radii. When all is still, head up
the stairs at (x=300, y=900).

***ITEMS***
(x=800, y=550) Chrysoberyl Gem, Potion of Healing,
	       ~Sanctified War Hammer +2*1
	       (3rd Play: War Hammer of Sparks +2*2)
	       (7th Play: War Hammer +2*3)
(x=300, y=600) 98 gold, Potion of Hill Giant Strength

*1: This isn't as good as the Sanctified Morning Star +3 I found
earlier, or The Giving Star/The Love of Black Bess, but it's still a
decent alternative, if you've thrown some proficiency points into
Hammers.
  ---
*2: The best of the War Hammers you can get here-this specimen has a
+2 enhancement bonus, a 50% chance to deal +1d3 electrical damage, and
a 10% chance to stun targets.
  ---
*3: A humble +2 War Hammer that always does one point of electrical
Damage. Veterans of Baldur's Gate should be familiar with weapons like
this-being a virtual clone of the War Hammer +2 'Ashideena'.

***ITEM FISHING***
I've been somewhat wishy-washy about doing a whole lot of work for
some items, but the next level presents a rare opportunity. Not only
is there an absolutely fantastic item to get-it's rather easy to do!
Sure, you're going to have to fight for it, but it's a simple as
saving, checking, and reloading until you get what you want. On the
next level, in the container at (x=670, y=420) you have a chance to
score a suit of Elven Chain Mail of the Hand +3. It's got a base Armor
Class of 2, and it doesn't prevent Mages from casting spells or
Thieves from sneaking-it's the ideal armor for my triple-classed
spell-casters. There is absolutely no reason you shouldn't walk out of
the next level with this armor. It goes on Ilnathias, who hands his
Ring of Protection +2 down to Amirule. Sooner or later I'll have two
front-liners with a great Armor Class.

Solonor Tower, Level 3 (AR5203)
o======================================================================o
9) Upon reaching this level you'll find an Elven Priest apparently in
the middle of a service. That's one of the things that really bothers
me about religion, folks. I remember, as a kid, going to Catholic
services and being absolutely bored out of my mind.. and I know what the
trade-off is supposed to be-eternal life in heaven, but it's honestly
not the myth of hellfire that scares me, it's this-the thought of being
dead, in an afterlife, stuck in a church service for all eternity. Yes,
mass in Catholic church was so boring, it made the thought of going to
hell less fearsome than going to heaven. Anyways, there are Clerics and
Acolytes here, as well as a Priest leading the service. The Clerics and
Priests should be, again, a priority, as they'll cast bad magic at you.
Throw Silence 15' Radius around liberally to shut them, up, then smash
them. When the priest falls he'll drop a holy symbol, of which I've
found the following:

(1st Play: Symbol of Labelas Enoreth*1)
(7th Play: Symbol of Shevarash*2)
(7-x Play: Symbol of Corellon Latheran*3)
(7-xx Play: Symbol of Solonor Thelandira*4)

Once you're done, go up the stairs at (x=900, y=800). You should be all
smiles about your new suit of Elven Chain Mail of the Hand +3.

Note from Lee:
Two Web spells and an Entangle ends this fight... at least for them.
I have not spell-bufffed for any fight so far in the game, using the
simple strategy of immobilizing my enemies and shooting them to death
from a distance, and/or drawing them to me to be chopped into bits. As
I had to go thru this excercise 5 times to get the Elven Chain Mail of
the Hand +3, I am certain it works, but I must reiterate that this
strategy is NOT for the faint of heart, and can lead to some serious
damage if the fight is not micro-managed well. It is also NOT usable at
all for HoF mode.

***ITEMS***
(x=700, y=820) Waterstar Gem, Potion of Heroism
(x=650, y=700) Oil of Speed (curse),
	       Scroll of Minor Globe of Invulnerability*5
(x=670, y=420) Piece of Broken Machinery*6, 68 gold, Potion of Defense,
	       ~Potion of Strength Transference*7
	       (3rd play: Elven Chain Mail of the Hand +3*8)
	       (4th play: Ring of Strength*9)

*1: This amulet gives a +1 bonus to intelligence. There's no reason to
wear this amulet all the time, but if I hit the 18 spell limit for one
of my Mages, I'll wear this amulet while I scribe scrolls to give
myself temporary unlimited spells/level.
  ---
*2: A humble necklace that grants its wearer Infravision. I don't see
the point.
  ---
*3: The best amulet that drops here, it'll give the wearer a +2 bonus
to THAC0. All things considered, I'd rather keep the Black Wolf
Talisman.
  ---
*4: Like the Symbol of Corellon Latheran, this amulet gives a +2 bonus
to THAC0.. but only for ranged weapons.
  ---
*5: This spell protects the caster from all 1st-3rd level spells. It has
it's uses, but enemies will soon start throwing more powerful spells
your way.
  ---
*6: Another piece of machinery you'll need to finish up your business
in the Hand. Again, keep ahold of it. It's the second of four pieces.
  ---
*7: Another attribute-swapping potion, this time you'll lose a point of
Strength and gain a point of Dexterity. We can score plenty of Guantlets
of Ogre Power in the Heart of Winter expansion, making Strength a non-
issue attribute, so this actually isn't a bad trade-off.. if you plan
to harvest these (and of course, only use them once you have Gauntlets
of Ogre Power to cover your Strength loss!) But that's simply too much
grinding, even for me. You'd need six of these potions to increase your
Dexterity to 24 (assuming, of course, a base of 18), which would lower
your Armor Class by a whopping two points.
  ---
*8: With a base Armor Class of two and +20% Cold Resistance, this may
well be the best armor you've found all game.. at least, if you didn't
find Shadowed Plate Mail Armor earlier. The fact that it can be worn
by dual-or-multi-classed Mages while allowing them to retain their
spell-casting abilities is beyond awesome (not to mention Thieves).
I gleefully put this armor on my Ilnathias, my party leader. He hands
his Ring of Protection +2 down to Amirule for now.
  ---
*9: +1 Strength, -1 Dexterity. This little ring sounds like it could be
useful, but it's +1 Strength caps at 18/00. For my fighters, that's
really not worth losing the Dexterity over.

Solonor Tower, Level 4 (AR5204)
o======================================================================o
10) Go through the door at (x=520, y=650) to find.. more doors! Through
the door at (x=700, y=700) you'll find two Acolytes and a Cleric that
are in need of some urgent smiting. Once smote, loot the room and grab
the Barrel of Holy Water, another item that should seem questy. I would
comment on the long odds of us finding a quest-item in the middle of a
frozen wasteland, but finding holy water in a priestly tower seems
rather.. well, sensible. Now open the door at (x=450, y=550) to find
another room with two Acolytes and a Cleric. Once you're done killing
them, you've cleared the level. Loot the rest of the rooms and when
you're done, head back to level one of Solonor Tower.

***ITEMS***
(x=730, y=800) Scroll of Cure Serious Wounds,
	       Scroll of Emotion: Courage, Barrel of Holy Water*1,
	       Potion of Fire Resistance, Potion of Insight
(x=900, y=800) Scroll of Flame Strike, Elixer of Health,
	       Symbol of Sehanine Moonbow*2
(x=260, y=500) Potion of Regeneration, Scroll of Remove Curse,
	       Ring of Sanctuary*3
(x=950, y=200) Potion of Purification, Potion of Perception,
	       Scroll of Remove Paralysis
(x=830, y=300) Shandon Gem, Potion of Absorption,
	       Scroll of Protection from Fire
(x=1070, y=550) Scroll of Flame Strike, Potion of Mind Focusing

*1: Denaini mentioned needing some Holy Water, right? You should
probably keep your hands on this until we get a chance to take it down
to her.
  ---
*2: This amulet has five charges of Find Traps and five charges of
Know Alignment. We already have a Thief, and any low-level Cleric can
cast Know Alignment.
  ---
*3: This useless ring can be used to cast Sanctuary five times.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Talk to Denaini again and tell her the good news-you've killed all
her friends and she's now the only undead sentient being trapped in a
hellish afterlife. Talk to her again and hand over the holy water we
found. You'll get a much larger experience reward for completing this
quest. At least her pathetic existence won't be quite as bleaks now.
Isn't that an awful lot of holy water? How did we get that down here?
Oh well, time to move on to another tower!

***REWARD***
(For killing the crazed occupants of Solonor Tower)
EXP	24000
Item	Edley's Sling*1

***REWARD***
(For bringing Denaini some Holy Water)
EXP	52500
Item	Sune's Laurel of Favor*2

*1: A +2 damage, +3 THAC0 sling. This'll do well on any of my Clerics,
even if I can't think of a single instance of when I actually bothered
to use a Sling.
  ---
*2: This Laurel gives a +1 bonus to armor class and a +1 bonus to
Charisma. Since it doesn't give critical hit protection, it won't do for
a dedicated fighter.

***ITEM FISHING***
You can fish for some Long Bows on the first level of Corellon Tower.
The container at (x=930, y=350) is our target, and by now you should be
prepared for the inevitable ambush that comes with it. The best of the
bows ahead is the Long Bow of Action +2.

Corellon Tower, Level 1 (AR5301)
o======================================================================o
12) Return to level four of the Hand and head over to Corellon Tower
(x=2000, y=500). There is an Elven Officer at (x=640, y=300). As you
approach him, a number of Swordsmen and Archers will appear, as well as
a Wizard at (x=260, y=460). This battle actually bears some preparation.
I leave the rest of my party in the room with the stairs in order to
bottleneck the enemy at the door while my Fighter/Mage/Thief sneaks into
the room. When you approach the Officer the baddies will appear and move
to attack. My party blocks them at the door, while my sneaking character
either starts off things right with a backstab on the Wizard, or just
shoots them down. The Wizard is, of course, the biggest threat, as he's
fond of casting Haste on his buddies, and Stinking Cloud-taking
advantage of the fact that his allies won't be harmed by it. Once again,
our best counter is to use Haste, Draw Upon Holy Might, Prayer,
Recitation, Emotion: Courage, Emotion: Hope, and extreme violence. When
you're done killing and looting, head upstairs to the next level at
(x=800, y=1000).

***HoF***
Keep a Dispel Magic ready in case the Elves Haste themselves, and do
your best to shoot down any enemy Mages they have. A single Flame Arrow
spell from one of their Mages can hit for a ludicrious 120 damage.
Still, with all the enemies around, it can be damn near impossible to
safely close on an enemy spell caster. The least you can do is fling a
Silence 15' Radius and hope for the best. Casting a Globe of
Invulnerability on your characters will limit the number of offensive
spells they can bring to bear on you.

Note from Lee:
Again, two pre-emptive Webs and an Entangle into the room puts the
entire enemy force at a serious disadvantage. Wait by the door and they
will eventually all come to you. The nice thing about this tactic is
that the enemy Mage is outside the fog of war for most of the initial
stages of the battle, making for a very easy time of it. The Mage casts
Slow first (or at least he did for me), but Rings of Free Action allows
me to simply go in and hack him to death while the rest of the party
waits outside until the spell wears off.

***ITEMS***
(x=930, y=350) ~Composite Long Bow of the Hand*1
	       (3rd play: Long Bow of Action +2*2)
	       (6th play: Long Bow of Marksmanship*3)

*1: A simple +2 damage, +2 THAC0 Long Bow.
  ---
*2: The Long Bow of Action +2 gives a +2 bonus to damage and a +3 bonus
to THAC0, as well as a decent +1 bonus to Dexterity. If this raises your
Dexterity from 18 to 19, you'll get a +1 THAC0 bonus while using missile
weapons. You'll have a shot at another, better, bow later, and the Long
Bow +2: Defender is certainly better, but if you've got a lot of hungry
archers to feed..
  ---
*3: +3 THAC0, +2 damage. Nothing to write home about.

Corellon Tower, Level 2 (AR5302)
o======================================================================o
13) This level plays out much like the one above, through a doorway to
the north three Officers stand around a table, planning for a war that
has already been lost. When you enter the room, reinforcements will
appear, this time including a Cleric and a Wizard to the west and
east, respectively. Again, pay especial attention to the spellcasters,
giving the Wizard priority over the Cleric. Once you're victorious,
the stairs to the third level are at (x=800, y=1000).

***HoF***
Again, take out the Mage first. I cast a Haste spell, walked in and
killed the Mage, then just let the fight go. This is where having an
Armor Class of -15 and a THAC0 of -7 on most of my party really comes in
handy. No weak links means the enemy has to earn every bit of damage.
One of my characters does get pretty banged up, but it's nothing a
Heal spell can't fix.

Note from Lee:
I actually took some damage in this fight, from "friendly fire". I added
a Spike Growth to the normal pre-emptive Web + Entangle strategy, got
caught in my own Web, and took damage from the 'spikes'. Not one enemy
laid a single hit on me though...

***ITEMS***
(x=390, y=550) Scroll of Otiluke's Resilient Sphere*1, 81 gold,
	       Scroll of Cloudkill*2, Oil of Fiery Burning
(x=870, y=600) Scroll of Icelance, Scroll of Stoneskin*3, Ziose Gem
(x=910, y=500) Piece of Broken Machinery*4

*1: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere is a spell I never tend to bother with.
Sure, it essentially removes an enemy from the fight for a while, but
as a 4th level spell with no save penalty, you might as well use
Confusion. Confusion has a save penalty, an area of effect, and a longer
duration. If you want to use a spell to remove enemies from the fight,
use Confusion.
  ---
*2: A decent 5th level spell, it kills weaker creatures outright.. but
by this point, you really won't be fighting any enemies that are that
weak. It's useful in combination with several Web spells, as it'll
keep a creature stuck in the effect for a long time. This is my advice
for all cloud spells, like Death Fog, Icendiary Cloud, Malavon's
Corrosive Fog-use them only in conjunction with Web, or not at all.
  ---
*3: This is THE defensive spell for a Mage. It blocks a number of
physical attacks regardless of how strong the attacks are. Essentially
it makes you immune to the next 1d4+1/2 levels attacks. This doesn't
protect against spells, but in conjunction with Mirror Image and Blur,
your Mage will be very difficult to hurt. Obviously a must-have for all
of our aspiring juggernauts. Cherish it, and scribe it wisely, you
won't find another until the Trials of the Luremaster dungeon pack.
  ---
*4: Another quest item you need to keep your hands on. This is the third
of the four pieces we've found.

***ITEM FISHING***
We've fished for a lot of items, and found plenty of good items, but
hasn't this game been a little light on Long Swords? Yeah, they're a
staple. Sure, we found a Long Sword of Confusion +2 earlier, but
otherwise it's been pretty lean. On the third level of Corellon Tower
you'll get a chance to fish for Long Swords in the container at
(x=850, y=500). The best of these swords is the Long Sword of the Hand,
which is a +3 weapon.

Corellon Tower, Level 3 (AR5303)
o======================================================================o
14) This level is a change of pace-down tempo, at that. The only foes
you'll face are a handful of seperated Elven Officers. They don't have
spells, and they don't have numbers, so they shouldn't pose any threat
to you. Just head around the level, killing and looting. When you're
done, the stairs up are at (x=500, y=900).

***ITEMS***
(x=870, y=620) Scroll of Remove Curse
(x=850, y=500) Potion of Storm Giant Strength,
	       ~Long Sword of Action +2*1, Arrows of the Hand x40
	       (3rd Play: Long Sword of the Hand*2)
	       (7th Play: Life's Gift*3)
(x=570, y=330) Waterstar Gem, Potion of Agility, Berduskan Black Brew
(x=500, y=450) 94 gold, Potion of Freedom,
	       Scroll of Protection from Lightning

*1: A Long Sword that gives a +1 bonus to dexterity. Unfortunately, a
19 dexterity doesn't give any Armor Class bonus, so this sword is
inferior to the Flaming Long Sword +2.
  ---
*2: The Long Sword of the Hand is a simple +3 Long Sword.. which makes
it the best weapon you can score on this level.
  ---
*3: A Long Sword +2 that has a 15% chance to heal the wielder 1d3 points
of damage.

Corellon Tower, Level 4 (AR5304)
o======================================================================o
15) At the top of the tower you'll meet Valestis, who'll ask you to find
him some "seeds that can flourish in the harshest of places", some
"pure water", and any "small animals seeking a new home." Unlike the
holy water that Denaini wanted, none of these things are terribly close
to the Severed Hand, so we'll be a while in fulfilling his desires.
Anyhow, that's all for Corellon Tower. Head back down to the main level.

***ITEM FISHING***
If you thought the Elven Chainmail of the Hand +3 was good, you were
right. But there's even BETTER armor we can get on the first level of
Sheverash Tower (AR5401). On that level is a character called Kaylessa
who will give us a quest. Once it's done, she'll give us one piece
of Kaylessa gear-either her Gloves, Ring, Bow, or Armor. This item
requires us to go through all of Sheverash Tower and most of Labelas
Tower to complete her quest, so obviously it's not something we can
fish for, right? No. Make a hard save before you enter Sheverash Tower,
then make a quick save within Sheverash Tower. Kill Kaylessa and loot
her. She'll drop Boots of Speed and one of the Kaylessa items above.
What she drops now is what she'll give you at the end of her quest, so
make sure she's got the armor, then reload your quick save. If she
doesn't have the armor, reload your hard save and try again. Again,
there is no reason you shouldn't leave with her armor.

Sheverash Tower, Level 1 (AR5401)
o======================================================================o
16) Explore to the east now and enter the final tower that's still
standing, Sheverash Tower (x=2600, y=1200). In this level you'll find
the spirit of Kaylessa, weapon master of the Hand. She has a Piece of
Broken Machinery, which, of course, you need. She'll ask you to kill
what's left of her men before she hands the treasure over. Didn't we
just do something like this? Oh well. She'll reveal that Larrel is now
a Baelnorn, an Elven Lich-like creature. I didn't think Lichdom was a
race-specific thing, but whatever. Let Elves have their own fancy names
for undead abominations. Apparently the Larrel we've seen is just a
projection-a figment of Larrel. She'll also reveal one last bit of
information-that Larrel's astrolabe is broken. How fixing this astrolabe
will help is currently a mystery, but we know it must be done! You can
unlock the doors and fight the Ogre and Orcs if you wish. The stairs up
are at (x=400, y=800).

***ITEMS***
(x=400, y=200) 93 gold.

Sheverash Tower, Level 2 (AR5402)
o======================================================================o
17) There are a number of Swordsmen and Archers on this level. Having so
many capable Fighters really comes in handy here. The only thing that
can be tricky about this area is the tendency for some of the Elven
Archers to shoot at your weaker party members.. of course, a properly
built party doesn't have much of a weak-spot, which helps. Spell buff
before you go upstairs and everything is fine. When everything is dead,
the ramp up is at (x=500, y=200).

***HoF***
After the Mages in Correlon's Tower, this should be a breeze. Again,
I can't help but expose the fact that even my 'weakest' character, my
Fighter/Mage/Thief, has an Armor Class of -15 and comparable Hit Points
to my melee characters. There's really no weakness for the archers to
exploit, and thus, no real strategy involved in this fight.

Sheverash Tower, Level 3 (AR5403)
o======================================================================o
18) More Archers and Swordsmen, they again will make a concerted effort
to attack any weak links (especially the two Swordsmen to the west.)
There are stairs up at (x=300, y=600) and a passage at (x=100, y=500).
Head up the stairs first.

**ITEMS***
(x=650, y=250) Scroll of Beltyn's Burning Blood*1, Shandon Gem, 95 gold
(x=800, y=530) Arrows of the Hand x40

*1: This spell deals 3-12 damage to a creature per round and each round
it lasts it has a chance to drive the target berserk. Lasting one round
per two levels as a Mage, that's a pretty good chance to take effect.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work on undead or extraplanar creatures, which
comprise many of the bosses and well over half the foes in the game.

Sheverash Tower, Roof (AR5404)
o======================================================================o
19) On top of the tower are three doors (x=200, y=450), (x=450, y=500),
and (x=650, y=600). Behind each of the doors are several Wraith Spiders,
which should be easy experience at this point in the game. Kill them,
loot, and return to level three and exit the western edge of the map at
(x=100, y=500).

Note from Lee:
Opening any door will open all three, so you'll have a pant-load of
spiders to deal with all at once. Not that they're all that difficult
to kill, but it's still best to know what's going to happen...

***ITEMS***
(x=700, y=470) Hippogriff Riders of the Hand, 57 gold.

Walkway between Sheverash Tower and Labelas Tower (AR5502)
o======================================================================o
20) On the walkway you'll find three Swordsmen, two Archers, a Cleric
and a Wizard. I have my Fighter/Mage/Thief sneak up while the rest of my
party engages. I take out the Wizard with a backstab, my two characters
with Rings of Free Action lead the assault, while the rest of my
Fighter/Mage/Clerics cast Silence 15' Radius at the Cleric. Then the
melee mop-up begins. Once they're all dead, exit to the next area
(x=50, y=400).

***HoF***
Again with the Mages. I Haste and simply blitz past the Swordsmen and
kill the Mage, then the Cleric. Then I just let the AI take over and
mop up.

***ITEM FISHING***
The next level has a good bit of suck on it, but there is a decent
Quarter Staff you can fish for. Find the Staff of the Hand in the
container at (x=330, y=320).

Labelas Tower, Level 4 (AR5104)
o======================================================================o
21) When you reach this level, don't move. The door to the north will
open on its own, and beyond there are two Swordsmen, a Cleric, and a
Wizard. This Wizard is fond of Hasting his allies, casting Ice Storm,
and even Confusion, which is a very dangerous spell. There are also more
Wizards in the other rooms which might show up when you start with the
violence. My strategy? I Haste up, rush the Mage and quickly kill him.
When the other Mages show up I have all my Fighter/Mage/Clerics cast
Silence 15' Radii on them, then I mop up in melee. When you've crushed
your opposition, loot around, as there are some rather good Mage scrolls
around.

***HoF***
Still with the Haste in effect from before, I run in and again focus
on the Mages. Thankfully they're more focused on buffing themselves
and their allies than they are on unleashing offensive magic, at least
at first. Put them down quickly and you'll have no troubles.

Note from Lee:
Okay, so I actually buffed for this fight; first time in the game. This
fight can be rough if you're not prepared, as the Mages will cause you
no end of grief if they manage to get spells off. Unfortunately, there
is no way to pre-emptively Web, Entangle, or otherwise impede them
without getting caught in your own area of effect, so Haste and charge
it is...

***ITEMS***
(x=330, y=320) Diary of Evayne*1, ~Robe of the Hand*2, 82 gold,
	       Potion of Clarity.
	       (6th Play: Dagger +2)
	       (7th Play: Staff of the Hand*3)
(x=1000, y=450) Scroll of Protection from Normal Missiles,
		Potion of Heroism, Potion of Invisibility
(x=200, y=460) Scroll of Improved Invisibility*4,
	       Scroll of Greater Malison*5, Potion of Genius

*1: Evayne is the daughter of Larrel, as you will discover by reading
this journal. It does little but to provide more backstory, and inform
you that Evayne ran off to Dorn's Deep. There's a good dose of quest
experience involved in finding out more about Evayne, quite a bit
later on. Keep it handy for when we meet Larrel.
  ---
*2: A humble +3 Quarter Staff. I have no characters that are restricted
enough that they have to resort to using this weapon.
  ---
*3: These robes have a laughable Armor Class of nine, impose a -2
penalty to Dexterity, and give +40% Cold, Fire, and Electrical
Resistance. If you have a character who can benefit from this, you're
not doing something right.
  ---
*4: This spell is an invaluable defensive measure. Invisibility is good
and all, but even after you make yourself known the -4 penalty on attack
rolls enemies suffer and the +4 bonus on saves you recieve are a good
reason to use this spell. on top of all of that, while invisible you
cannot be targeted by spells, even after you've acted. You can still be
hurt by area effect spells, however.
  ---
*5: Greater Malison lowers the saves of enemies by 2. This is a great
first strike spell that makes all other spells work more often. Hitting
the enemy with two Greater Malisons from two Mages using Improved
Invisibility is a good start to a fight. Afterward, everything else is
much more likely to succeed, especially Slow, Confusion, Symbol of
Hopelessness, and all that good stuff.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
22) Now, we've crushed the last of Kaylessa's former soldiers in the
tower. Continuing will take us to Larrel... but why bother without her
piece of the astrolabe? Head back down to the first level of Sheverash
Tower and tell her about killing her friends. Kaylessa will thank you,
and asks one last favor of you.. You guessed it, she wants to die in
battle as well. One would think her energy could be better wasted on
Orcs and Goblins, but hey, I guess we're conventient. Kill her, and put
the last resident of Sheverash Tower to rest. Kaylessa will drop a
Broken Piece of Machinery*1, some Boots of Speed*2 and a variety of..
er... Kaylessa gear, as follows:

(1st Play: Kaylessa's Gloves*3)
(3rd Play: Kaylessa's Bow*4)
(6th Play: Kaylessa's Ring*5)
(7th Play: Kaylessa's Armor*6)

***REWARD***
(For putting Kaylessa's soldiers to rest)
EXP	52500

*1: The fourth and final piece of machinery we need for Larrel's
astrolabe.
  ---
*2: Boots of Speed are nice little items that double the wearer's speed.
The problem is, this is a good benefit for ANY character, deciding who
gets to use them is tricky business. All things considered, however,
I'd rather have the Boots of the Fox. I'll trade the lesser speed bonus
for a bonus to Armor Class.
  ---
*3: The only characters that will benefit from having 19 Dexterity are
archers, and particularly Thieves. You won't get an Armor Class boost
from 19 Dexterity, but you will get a +1 bonus to your THAC0 with
ranged weapons. Thieves will also get a bonus to their thieving skills,
for what that's worth.
  ---
*4: A +3 Long Bow that gives a +1 bonus to Dexterity. It's a great bow
for any archer, although whether it's better than the Long Bow +2:
Defender or not is open to debate. The latter deals less damage, and
possibly less THAC0 due to the former's Dexterity bonus, but it's hard
to argue against a +2 Armor Class bonus and +2 Save vs. Spells.
  ---
*5: This ring that adds 15% to Hide in Shadows, and is only usable by
Rangers. I have no Rangers, and even if I did, I'd still be inclined to
say this ring is garbage.
  ---
*6: Kaylessa's Chainmail is simply called 'Chainmail Armor', but it
looks identical to Elven Chainmail of that Hand... which is because it
IS identical to it! Well, in all the ways that matter, anyways. It also
gives you a +1 bonus to Dexterity, which won't improve your Armor Class
if it raises to 19, but it will give you a +1 THAC0 bonus with missile
weapons. Getting one party-friendly suit of Elven Chainmail in this
place is wonderful. Getting two is insane. I put this on Syrenil for
two reasons-first, she's one of the few Mages that actually has spells
to cast. Second, the +1 Dexterity bonus will actually help her out.

Labelas Tower, Level 5 (AR5102)
o======================================================================o
23) Now, backtrack up Sheverash Tower, then cross to Labelas Tower, and
head up the stairs up are at (x=900, y=800). On this library level
you'll find Custhantos. He cannot be convinced that he is dead and the
Hand has fallen, but he will give you a variety of books. Of particular
interest, of course, is the book Mythal Theory*1. The stairs up are at
(x=700, y=700).

*1: This is the tome that Orrick so desperately wants. Next time you're
in Kuldahar, be sure to give it to him. Hopefully, once he has this book
he can get the hell out of Icewind Dale. Don't worry, you'll be reminded
again when we officially return to Kuldahar, once we're done in the
Hand.

Labelas Tower, Level 6 (AR5103)
o======================================================================o
24) On top of this tower you'll find Larrel, Gelarith (x=500, y=400),
and the broken astrolabe. Larrel is not in any condition to help you
with the Heartstone Gem, so talk to Gelarith instead. If you haven't
figured it out already, you'll have to find the missing pieces of the
astrolabe in order to fix it. You should already have all four pieces
of machinery, so hand them over (be sure to turn the difficulty up for
a huge series of quest rewards!)

***REWARD***
(For giving Gelarith the piece you found on an undead shadow)
EXP	35000

***REWARD***
(For giving Gelarith the piece you found in in Solonor Tower)
EXP	24000

***REWARD***
(For giving Gelarith the piece you found in the war room)
EXP	35000

***REWARD***
(For giving Gelarith the picee you obtained from Kaylessa)
EXP	24000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
25) After you give him all these pieces, you can talk to Larrel. He'll
tell you about the fall of the Hand if you wish (which gives him plenty
of opportunity to vent his racism against everything that's not an Elf,
especially Dwarves). About why repairing the astrolabe restored him:
apparently he was turned into a Baelnorn as punishment by the god
Labelas Enoreth until his people were laid to rest in the Hand-a task
that repairing the astrolabe somehow necessitated. Of course, by his own
admission Larrel doesn't regret using 'the most ancient of elven magic
with carelessness', nor did he repent of his racism, so I have to
question what the point of keeping him here all this time was-if
punishing him didn't change his opinions, why bother? Talk to Larrel
again and tell him about the Evayne's Journal, which will prompt more
racism from him. If ONLY we could find some EVIDENCE about his
daughter's fate? Wouldn't THAT be a most UNLIKELY coincidence? Anyways,
get Larrel to use the Heartstone Gem to find the evil plaguing the
north. Your next destination is Dorn's Deep-surprise of surprises-and
Larrel is nice enough to send you there with magic. Too bad we can never
learn such teleportation magic.

Note: When you travel to Dorn's Deep, Chapter 3 ends and Chapter 4
begins. Be sure to have purchased the Shimmering Sash before starting
Chapter 4!

***REWARD***
(For giving Larrel the Heartstone Gem)
EXP	54000

o======================================================================o
We stormed the Severed Hand, completed our objective, and Kuldahar
didn't end up full of Orogs.. so I suppose you could call this our most
successful mission thus far. Of course, our quest is now following the
narrative thread of the distant past. Larrel blames the Dwarves of
Dorn's Deep for providing weapons that turned the tide in the battle
against the Elves, although the falling out between the two races
probably had more of a strategic impact than any weapons did. Whatever
the case, Larrel blames the Dwarves of Dorn's Deep for many evils. It
just so turns out that the Heartstone Gem revealed that the evil that
threatens Kuldahar lies within Dorn's Deep? Coincidence? We'll find out.

Dorn's Deep, Exterior (AR6000)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK014}
		1) Even More New Stock From Orrick
		2) Down into the Darkness

		4) Orc Cave
		5) Orog Cave
		6) Banter with Bandoth
		7) More Myconid Mayhem!
		8) Ettin Cave
		9) Down, Down to Dwarven Town..

1) Even though we have some business in Kuldahar, the next chapter
doesn't begin until we travel to Dorn's Deep, so get Larrel to send you
there, and promptly head back to Kuldahar. Go pay Orrick a visit (after
selling off whatever other crap you've been carrying around) and give
him the book Mythal Theory you obtained in the Severed Hand. He also
sells a few new items.

Mantle of Hell's Furnace
A cloak that allows its wearer to cast Agannazar's Scorcher, Burning
Hands, or Charm Elemental Kin. I can't really recommend shelling out
over ten thousand gold for an item that allows you to cast two low
level Mage spells and a spell that's only useful against very rare
enemies.
  ---
Ogi-Luc's Great Robe
This robe looks pretty nifty at a glance-it lowers your Armor Class to
a base of four and gives you 18/99 Strength and +2 Constitution. Score!
Except it can only be used by a single-classed Mage. I suppose this is
built-in Tenser's support for the single-classed Mage, but it can't
compete with the doubled Hit Points, native high Strength and weapon
proficiencies that our dual-or-multi-classed characters will have.

***REWARD**
(For retrieving the Mythal Theory book for Orrick)
EXP	24000
Item	Girdle of Labelas*1

  ---or---

Item	Mithran's Cloak*2

  ---or---

Item	The Elfbone Ring of Khan-Hai*3

*1: Grants the wearer Freedom of Action and lets them cast Haste 1/day.
Unfortunately, it's a belt, and the Shimmering Sash is going to win
this little competition.
  ---
*2: A nice cloak that gives a +3 bonus to Armor Class and a +2 bonus to
Saves. Of course, if you're having trouble finding room for Rings of
Protection +2 you might not have much use for this cloak. Ultimately the
Wailing of Virgins wins out in Heart of Fury mode, as its own Armor
Class modifiers are comparable, and its immunity to fear-based effects
like Emotion: Hopelessness and Symbol of Hopelessness make up for the
lack of saves. Best of all, it (unlike this cloak) can be worn with any
sort of armor. This ultimately goes to Amirule, who is now wearing
Kresselack's Plate Mail Armor and Helmet, and wielding the Shield of
the Hand for a total Armor class of -7. Amirule, for her part, passes
down the Ring of Protection +2 down to Nauzhir the Red. Kaelinalia will
find a good suit of enchanted armor soon enough.
  ---
*3: This humble-seeming ring gives its wearer a very welcome +2 bonus to
the Paralysis, Poison, and Death Magic Save, and outright immunity to
Finger of Death and Death Spell. I don't really recall having to worry
about those two spells very often, but the save is something that will
be tested rather frequently.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) When you're done shopping in Kuldahar, head back to Dorn's Deep. From
where you arrive head southwest, then west. A Neo Orog will initiate
dialogue and politely tell you that you're trespassing, and now you're
going to get a slight case of death. Kill him, and all his buddies,
hence putting doubt into their claims of land ownership. Continue until
you find a cave entrance at (x=500, y=100).

***HOF***
Hate to say it, but we'll actually have to fight for a bit in this
chapter. Living creatures means no Invisosmite.. All chapters can't be
as laughably easy as the last one was.. don't worry though, we will see
more Invisosmite in this chapter.

Dorn's Deep, Caverns (AR6001)
o======================================================================o
3) Once you enter, head southeast to reach a large cavern with lambent
blue mushrooms (not the ledge leading east above this). Here you'll
find Blue Myconids, mushroom-men that will typically start fights by
shooting spores at you. These spores are like the acid sprayed by the
Bombardier Beetles-they can stun you, and tastelessly ignore your Rings
of Free Action. Just spell buff up and hope that they don't stun any
characters.. or more realistically, that when they do stun somebody,
your other characters can cover them. Your goal here is to head east
through the cavern smiting Blue Myconids so they can't trouble you
later. Think about it, a narrow walk-way, with unreachable fungus-men
shooting stunning spores at you? It's a nuisance, one you can avoid by
simply killing them now.

Orc Cave (AR6009)
o======================================================================o
4) If you can halt your Myconid murder spree long enough, there's a
cave at (x=1550, y=450) that your mushroom massacre will take you past.
Inside are some Orc Elites, which are painfully laughable compared to
the Orcs you fought in the Severed Hand, if that's possible.

Neo Orog Cave (AR6008)
o======================================================================o
5) Exit the cave and switch back from Orc-obliteration mode to Myconid-
murder mode again and continue east until.. well, you can't go east
any further. Now backtrack to the entrance and take the elevated ledge
to the east we ignored at the outset. Another cave awaits at
(x=2100, y=200). Inside are more Neo Orogs, slightly less pathetic foes
than the Orcs were, but still no match for us. Smite them and leave.

Bandoth's Tower (AR6014)
o======================================================================o
6) Exit the Orog cave and continue east until you find an odd building
(x=3050, y=600). Within you'll find Bandoth (x=500, y=500). Since he's
not outright hostile, we might as well talk to him. You'll quickly
discover that, while he's not outright hostile, he's very close to it.
Pick dialogue option #1 three times and you'll be able to ask him some
questions. You can ask about Evayne (he's not helpful), the layout of
Dorn's Deep and the fate of it's Dwarven inhabitants (Orogs on the
upper levels, undead on the lower levels) and he'll also offer to tell
you how to get there if you perform a service for him-namely to find
the Razorvine Extract he sent his apprentice out to find. Agree to do
his little job, then talk to him again and pick dialogue options #1,
#5, and #1 to barter with him. He'll sell you a variety of potions and
some rather rare scrolls.. even though you probably won't use them, you
might want to buy them for the sake of spell-book completionism.

<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Once you're done bandying empty words and bartering with Bandoth,
leave his tower and return to the entrance. Descend back down to the
Myconid chamber, but explore south instead of east. Again, there are
two paths running parallel to each other down here. Along the eastern-
most path you'll find Ettins, and along the lower, blue-mushroom-lined
path are more Blue Myconids. Allowing Myconids to stun us from below
while we deal with Ettins is not a smart tactic, so head down the
western, lower path first and murderify your way east. When the
mushrooms cease and the path turns north, you'll meet another Ettin.
Chop it down and enter some caves to the north (x=2000, y=2000)

Ettin Cave (AR6007)
o======================================================================o
8) There's a quartet of Ettins in here, so you might want to Haste and
use some offensive magic (Slow and Confusion come to mind.) Ettins are
big, and can hit fairly hard, but they're simple melee creatures. Their
high amount of Hit Points won't save them, and their Armor Class doesn't
do them any favors. I had no trouble with them. Once you're done
toppling the Ettins, admire their skull art and loot the skeletal
remains at (x=700, y=550).

***HoF***
Predictably, there are more Ettins here than usual, but they don't have
any tricks up their sleeves. With everything having so many extra
Hit Points, Ettins don't seem very special anymore, in fact they seem
underpowered, if anything.

***ITEMS***
(x=700, y=550) Container of Razorvine Extract*1.

*1: This is what Bandoth wants. Notice the Planescape: Torment
reference in the item description. Who knows how Mourns-for-Trees got
ahold of-and subsequently lost-this stuff.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Return to Bandoth and tell him about the fate of his apprentice.
Not surprisingly he seems more upset about having to find another
lackey than anything else. He will, however, tell us how to reach
the lower regions of Dorn's Deep. Head back to the Myconid/Ettin
split, and this time explore the previously ignored elevated (eastern)
path. Explore it eastwards and smite whatever Ettins shows their
faces. You'll pass over the Ettin cave we previously explored, after
which head southeast to find the bridge that leads to Dorn's Deep
(x=3500, y=1700).

***REWARD***
(For returning Bandoth's Razorvine Extract)
EXP	42000

Dorn's Deep (AR6002)
o======================================================================o
1) This area opens up into a big fight. Some Drow, some Orogs, some
Orc Archers, and a pair of Phase Spiders, whose express purpose seems to
be disrupting your rear characters (in most parties Mages and archers).
You'll be blocked on the bridge by a number of Orogs and Drow, while two
Drow Sorcerers and Orc Archers shoot at you from the sides. Here,
finally, is where my multi-class party excels. We've closed the Hit
Point gap that single-classed characters have enjoyed a great deal, and
our versatility makes this fight easy. I fully spell-buff with Prayer,
Draw Upon Holy Might, Recitation, Haste, Protection from Evil 10'
Radius, and personal buffs. Then I head out onto the bridge and try to
hit the two Drow Sorcerers with Silence 15' Radius. Drow have innate
magic resistance, so drop two on each side to increase your chances of
neutralizing the Mages. A Confusion and Slow spell thrown into the mix
can only help you out further. Once they're dead, loot. The Drow you'll
be facing in this level typically carry magical weapons-Long Swords +1
will be pretty standard fare. If you haven't saturated the market for
them by now, you can stand to earn a pretty penny or two by selling them
off in bulk. The Orogs here often carry High-Quality weapons, for what
it's worth.

***HoF***
This battle isn't very different in the higher difficulties. A Symbol of
Hopelessness or two on either side is enough to disrupt the archers, and
hopefully take down one of the Mages. If that doesn't work, there's
always missile fire. For the rest of the level, the rules we learned in
the Severed Hand apply: pay the Mages special attention and they won't
abuse you with any bad spells.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Good news? That was the roughest fight this level of Dorn's Deep
has to offer. Bad news? Well, it's pretty much a cake-walk from here
on out. Cross the bridge and explore to the east, where you'll find a
room filled with sarcophagi, occupied by Orcs and Orogs. Destroy them
and continue north, then east, to reach a forge, which is guarded by
two Drow Vanguards wielding Light Cross Bows and firing Bolts of
Biting (if you see the poisoned icon, this is why. These bolts will
deliver a total of thirty points of poison damage if you get hit by
them and fail to save), a Drow Sorcerer, and two Drow Spellswords,
who fail to contribute meaningfully. Lead with your best Armor Class
and try to shoot down the Drow Sorcerer, while your melee characters
try to engage the Drow Vanguards. When they're dead, loot them for their
magical gear, and grab the loot on the floor near the forge at
(x=2395, y=640).

***ITEMS***
(x=2395, y=640) Mithral Field Plate Armor +2*1, Axe of Caged Souls*2,
		Heavy Cross Bow of Accuracy*3, Bolt of Biting x10,
		Bolt of Lightning x10.

*1: With a base Armor Class of 0, this is tied for the most defensive
armor we've found. Of course, Shadowed Plate Mail Armor has a +3 bonus
versus Missile Weapons, as well, making it superior. Still, there's not
much chance you can't find a home for this armor-it's superior to
Plate Mail Armor and a Ring of Protection +2, which is what most of
my character have been stuck with. This goes on Kaelinalia, which-
along with the Reinforced Large Shield +1-brings her Armor Class down
to -6.
  ---
*2: A +3 Battle Axe that acts as a +5 weapon versus Cadaverous Undead.
A +3 weapon is still nothing to shake a stick at, and Cadaverous Undead
aren't terribly uncommon. Unfortunately it's a Battle Axe, so I have no
use for it.
  ---
*3: We found one of these in the Severed Hand. It's still too slow for
for consideration as a proper ranged weapon.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Now kill your way down to the southwest. Ignore the northern room
with the large circular table in the center of the room for now and
continue on until you reach an Orog-occupied room dominated by an
incredibly long table. In a sarcophagus-filled room to the west you'll
get the privelage of slaughtering more Orogs and Orcs. From the long-
table room head north into a room with three Drow Spellswords and two
Drow Vanguards, who guard the entrance to some caves (x=600, y=800),
which is where we should head next.

***HOF***
There will be an extra group of Dark Elves in the round table room in
Heart of Fury Mode, consisting of two Drow Vanguards, three Drow
Spellswords, and a Drow Sorcerer. Letting yourself get clogged fighting
the Spellswords in the doorway gives the Sorcerer a great opportunity
to cause mischief, but a pre-emptive spell-assault is likely to have..
less than ideal effects. Going invisible and surrounding the Sorcerer so
as to gink him early isn't a bad idea.

***ITEM FISHING***
The next level presents us with the opportunity to score a few pretty
good Battle Axes, including a +3 Battle Axe that has a chance to slow
foes, and a +2 Battle Axe that has a chance to stun and deal electrical
damage. You'll have to sneak past Orogs and Ettins, and go through
pretty much the whole level. Good news though-there are no foes near
the goodies (x=690, y=1940), so fighting only has to occur if you screw
up.

Krilag's Cave (AR6003)
o======================================================================o
4) Advance a short distance until you come across an Umber Hulk at
(x=1800, y=700) who claims to be a transformed red wizard named Saablic
Tan. Since he can speak (and since his name IS Saablic Tan on the
dialogue box) we should regard his story as plausible. He apparently
bred the Orogs in these caverns (and here I thought Orogs were a mix
of Orc and Ogre-shows how much I know!), and that he was apparently not
a nice master, which results in them being not so nice in return, now
that they have the upper hand. He wants you to kill the leader of these
Orogs, a brute named Krilag. Krilag isn't just the leader of these
Orogs (without whom the rest would scatter), he's also 'one of six'.
What this means, however, we do not yet know. Saablic Tan will promise
us more information after we return with Krilag's badge.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Now, I know I tend to like to procrastinate, but Krilag is awfully
close to us. From Saablic Tan, head southeast until you come to a fork
in the path. Ignore the southern path for now and keep going southeast.
Kill a few Orog guards along the way down and eventually you'll reach
a large chamber filled with the gentle glow of campfire. Inside is
Krilag, who wastes your time by talking to you. We all know how this
has to go down. Pick a fight (as if you could do anything else) and
crush Krilag and his cronies. If you expected them to put up much of a
fight.. you were expecting too much. When Krilag dies, loot his body
for some goodies, including the Cairn Blade*1, the 'Note to Krilag'*2,
and Krilag's Badge*3.

*1: A +4 Two Handed Sword.
  ---
*2: This interesting bit of correspondance mentions the transfer of
reponsibilities of magical affairs from Saablic Tan to one 'Malavon'.
Apparently Krilag inherited Saablic's 'badge of lieutenancy' when
Saablic Tan was deposed. The writer also informs Krilag (and hence us)
that these badges function as keys, and will grant its holder an
audience with the 'RBP' who wrote this letter. Well, we would VERY much
like to meet the leader of this little band. It also mentions the will
of 'Ilmater', and lists the next nearest peer as one 'Kreg Frostbeard',
who is holed up somewhere in Wyrm's Tooth. Interesting stuff..
  ---
*3: Krilag's Badge. As the letter suggested, this is important. Very
important. This is the item Saablic Tan wants. Note that you need to
hold onto this item for a pretty long time in order to use it to
progress the story later. Do not drop this item, as it will disappear
in earlier versions of the game, and nobody likes a show stopper. Even
in later versions, dropping it or misplacing it means you'll have to
track it down. Save yourself the trouble now and make a nice cozy spot
for it in your inventory.

***REWARD***
(For retrieving Kirlag's Badge)
EXP	35000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Return to Saablic Tan and show him Krilag's Badge. He'll tell you
what you already know-that if you go 'in search of him' you'll need each
of the six badges. He'll then wander off-none of that pussy 'put me out
of my misery' crap like those Elf sissies in the Severed Hand. Now to
explore the rest of this level. From Saablic Tan we can go four
directions. If you take the northern path to the west, you'll come to
a dead end. If you take the southern path to the west, you'll come to
another fork. Dammit! Continue south, then southwest to find a chamber
full of Orogs. Kill them and turn north, exploring a new tunnel. You'll
come to yet another fork. To the west-Ettins. Destroy a trio of them
and advance to the west until you come to another fork, at which head
south until you find a corpse with some loot nearby (x=690, y=1940).

***HoF***
The only real difference in Heart of Fury mode is the number of Neo
Orog Generals you'll fight en route to Krilag. Krilag himself, and his
entourage are nothing special.

***REWARD***
(For eliminating the Orog chieftan for Saablic Tan)
56000

***ITEMS***
(x=690, y=1940) Kalabac's Journal*1, Battle Axe +3: Fatigue*2
		(4th Play: Charged Battle Axe +2*3)
		(7th Play: Life Halberd +2*4)
		(7-X Play: Poisonous Battle Axe +2*5)

*1: The journal of some poor fool who got killed by the nearby Ettins
after following Bandoth's advice. He'll mention a puzzle ahead that
we'll have to solve to get to the Cemetery and the Forge.
  ---
*2: Probably the best Battle Axe we've found so far-it's a +3 specimen
with a 20% chance to to slow targets. Remember, a slowed melee foe is
all but dead. We'll also find one of these in the Heart of Winter
expansion, where it's a guaranteed drop.
  ---
*3: We could have found one of these earlier.. it's still a nice
weapon.
  ---
*4: A +2 Halberd that has a 10% chance to heal the wielder for 1d6
Hit Points. It seem painfully under-powered now.
  ---
*5: This +2 Battle Axe has a 25% chance to poison targets.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Return to Dorn's Deep, backtrack to the long table room and from it
head east. Head north at the circular room before the forge room to find
a room with a large circular table, lined with statues. One of the
statues has its hammer down-an obvious lever (which is dubiously
locked). Ignore it, as we can't do anything with it now. The secret door
Bandoth told us about is at (x=1600, y=450). Before you go down, note
the symbols on the dart-board like table. They MIGHT come in handy
shortly.

Puzzle Level (AR6010)
o======================================================================o
8) The floor of the room is set up like a giant dwarven dartboard-just
like the table on the level above! Except that the symbols aren't
uniform. Stepping on the wrong symbol will trigger a trap and generally
cause you some pain. The correct symbols are the ones on the table in
the room above. Your goal is to make it to the center of the dart-board
by only stepping on tiles with the correct symbols. After stepping on
the correct tile for that row, the entire row will be disarmed. So,
step as follows:

1) The hammer and anvil (x=900, y=400)
2) the crossed objects (not the swords) (x=600, y=750)
3) the co-centric circles (x=550, y=530)

Once you've solved all three, head upstairs and pull the hammer-lever
at (x=1680, y=540), and head back through the secret door. You can now
go down the stairs at (x=800, y=600.)

***REWARD***
(For solving the dwarven riddle and pulling the lever)
EXP	56000

Puzzle Interior (AR6011)
o======================================================================o
9) You're now beneath the puzzle level. Marvel at the wonderful
mechanics of the Dwarven puzzle! Eh.. really, there's not much to see
here, the exit is at (x=600, y=450), and there's a trap on the floor
near the dead body.

***ITEMS***
(x=470, y=440) Dver's Note*1

***TRAPS***
(x=400, y=450)

*1: This note only mentions the mental intrusions that seems to be
affecting various creatures in the Dale, and points out Krilag's Cave
behind the prison cells in Dorn's Deep.. you know, in case you were
too simple to find Krilag earlier.

Dead Forge (AR6004)
o======================================================================o
1) You've arrived at a dead forge, and we all know how Dwarves are
about their forges. It's like Wal-Mart and church combined! Except
Dwarven forge-workers probably get paid more than Wal-Mart employees,
and unlike churches, forges can be useful. Find the spirit of Norlinor
at (x=1420, y=770), aho will ask you whether you want to desecrate its
remains. It's a trick question! Pretend that you don't, or the ghost
won't talk to you anymore. You can talk to it about the collapse of
Dwarven-Elven relations, but the real point of interest is that a
Necromancer named Terikan has taken up residence in the Tiers of the
Dead. You know how this works-touchy undead has its dead ancestors
bothered by some well-meaning necromancer.. it wants us to put a stop
to Terikan and relight the forge here. Why Dwarves would tie their
afterlife to the functioning of a forge is beyond me-it would be like
me going on a Zombie rampage whenever anybody turned off my holy PC.
Anyways, the Dwarves of Dorn's Deep faced a two-fold threat. Not only
the Orc hordes, but the Battle of the Dead-dead awakened by a Negative
Energy Vortice that just so happens to be buried below Dorn's Deep,
which is what drew Terikan. Unlike Larrel, Norlinor believes that the
armament of the Orc hordes was a deliberate attempt by some agent to
foster mistrust between the Dwarves and Elves. Whatever the case, it
certainly led to the downfall of both races. Anyways, time to deal with
Terikan and his undead. To destroy Terikan, we'll have to do more than
deal with his physical shell-we'll need to destroy Terikan's phylactery.
To do so, we have to 'remove it from this plane'. Coincidence of
coincidences, we can do this by entering the vortice Terikan came here
to master-all we have to do is grab his phylactery and enter the tomb of
Jamoth. You can also pester Norlinor for healing services, if you for
some reason don't have a party full of Clerics. There are three arches
at (x=1100, y=700), (x=1500, y=600), and (x=1800, y=700). I pick the
first of the choices, since it'll put me at a flank and in a good
position to disable any traps I might face.

***ITEM FISHING***
There is an awful amount of item fishing that can be done in the next
level. There are plenty of traps guarding things, and undead-although
they are weak and easily smote (smitten?) The trouble, then, is just
the sheer number of items in the next level, all of which will be locked
once you enter. There's a great Short sword and Long Sword on the next
level (x=670, y=600), some Daggers at (x=950, y=1500), and best of all,
a chance to score the Reinforced Large Shield +2 at (x=1250, y=1500).
The Reinforced Large Shield +2 location also occassionally yields a War
Hammer +3. If you use any of the weapons above, you might want to
fish for some of these items.. I don't find anything save the Reinforced
Large Shield +2 and the War Hammer +3: Lifegiver terribly intriguing,
however. As for the shield.. we'll also find two Large Shields +1, +4
vs. Missiles in the next level, and the best shield of the game can
easily be purchased at the beginning of Heart of Winter, so you really
don't need to break your back fishing here.

Tiers of the Dead (AR6005)
o======================================================================o
2) As soon as you enter you'll be assaulted by some undead you could've
beaten back in the Vale of Shadows. Be sure you have party AI off, as
traps abound, and you don't need your characters chasing off any undead.
There's one trap to the east at (x=850, y=1570). Disarm it.. just
because it's near at hand. First, we'll explore the weatern tier.

***HOF***
The initial horde of Ghasts and Ghouls you'll fight when you enter this
area are immune to 'Turn Undead'.. for no legitimate reason as far as I
can determine. I would propose that the power of Terikan's nexus to the
Negative Energy Plane overwhelmed our priestly powers.. but every other
undead in this level can be smote with the ability, so it's probably
just a bug. So.. crush the horde of Ghouls and Ghasts the traditional
way, then Invisosmite.

Note: After looking it up on Infinity Explorer-my suspicions were
confirmed. The Ghouls and Ghasts on this level are listed-under the
'AI' tab, in the 'AI Parameters' section, as HUMANOID, instead of
UNDEAD. These Ghouls and Ghasts are different than the ones we fought
earlier in the Vale of Shadows, which were listed as 'KTGHL1' and
'KTGST1', respectively, whereas the ones you'll find here are 'UDGHOUL'
and 'UDGHAST'. The only combat difference between the two? Well.. being
HUMANOID, the UD-undead can suffer morale failure, unlike the KT-undead,
which actually count-and act-like undead. So.. long story short, it's
a bug.

***TRAPS***
(x=850, y=1570)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Head north and shoot down any undead you see. Go up some stairs
and disarm a trap at (x=600, y=950). There are more traps on the larger
stairs to the north, traps on a number of the sarcophagi, and plenty of
looting to do, so get to it.

***ITEMS***
(x=630, y=600) Dagger +1
(x=670, y=600) ~Bastard Sword +2: Conflagration*1
	       (3rd Play: Hold Fast*2)
	       (6th Play: Short Sword of Shadows +3*3)

(x=400, y=1150) Large Shield +1, +4 vs. Missiles*4
(x=450, y=1150) Buckler, ~Static Darts +3 x10
		(7th Play: Bolt of Lightning x10)

***TRAPS***
(x=600, y=950)
(x=620, y=750)
(x=700, y=600)
(x=450, y=970)
(x=400, y=1050)
(x=450, y=1150)

*1: An obnoxious weapon, it's a +2 Bastard Sword that has a 10%
chance to unleash a 5d6 damage Fireball. If you like the idea of having
a party-unfriendly Fireball blasting the wielder, their companions, and
NPCs one-in-ten hits, then this is the piece of garbage for you.
  ---
*2: This is a +3 Long Sword that has a 15% chance of casting Hold
Person, gives a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and 15% slashing resistance.
  ---
*3: The Short Sword of Shadows +3 is actually a pretty good Short
Sword. It has a +3 enhancement, gives a +2 bonus to Armor Class, and a
15% bonus to stealth. You'll have a chance to score another one of
these in the next room.
  ---
*4: A wonderful shield that gives a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +5
bonus versus Missile Weapons. If you've still been carrying around
Stoutward, it's time to retire it. Best of all, it's a static drop-
you'll always get one here.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Now backtrack to where you entered the level and explore to the
southeast. Mop up any undead on the large bridge lined with sarcophagi,
search and disarm any traps on said sarcophagi, and loot them.

***ITEMS***
(x=950, y=1500) Large Shield +1, +4 vs. Missiles*1, ~Chaos Dagger +3*2,
		~Static Darts x10
		(4th play: Mage Dagger +3*3)
(x=1000, y=1400) Battle Axe
(x=1000, y=1350) Warhammer, Small Shield +1
(x=1200, y=1550) Battle Axe
(x=1250, y=1500) ~War Hammer +3: Lifegiver*4
		 (3rd play: Reinforced Large Shield +2*5)
		 (6th play: Large Shield of Strength +1*6)

***TRAPS***
(x=950, y=1500)
(x=1250, y=1500)

*1: Another one! At the very least we have two of these shields (both
of which are guaranteed drops) and either the Red Knight's Shield or
the Bitch Queen's Envoy. With any luck we also have the Reinforced
Large Shield +1 and the Shield of the Hand, so all the melee-types
have good shields.
  ---
*2: A +3 Dagger that has a 20% chance to disease targets. Why is
disease chaotic? Your guess is as good as mine.
  ---
*3: A +3 Dagger that gives its wielder a bonus 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level
Mage spell, as well as +20% resistance to fire. It sounds awfully
tempting, but here, finally, is my issue with these daggers. Mages
should NOT be in melee combat, and if they are, they should at least
use reach weapons, like Quarter Staves. Switching out between weapons
will cause you to lose memorized spells that depend upon the weapon.
  ---
*4: With a +3 enhancement bonus, this is one of the better War Hammers
we've come across thus far. It has a 20% chance to heal its wielder for
1d4 Hit Points.
  ---
*5: One of the best shields in the game-this particular shield gives a
+3 bonus to Armor Class with an additional +1 bonus versus Missile
Weapons. In addition it grants 15% Fire Resistance and 15% Crushing
Resistance.
  ---
*6: This shield gives a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +1 bonus versus
Missile Weapons. It also gives a +1 bonus to Strength (maxes out at
18/00, as most +1 Strength items seem to in this game..) It also
bestows 10% resistances to Slashing and Piercing weapons. This is
actually a considerable alternative for the Large Shield +1, +4 vs.
Missiles or the Shield of the Hand. The bonus to Strength, while less
than it should be, will give all my front-liners a +1 bonus to damage
and THAC0.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Once you're done looting go upstairs, where you'll find our Lich
guarded by a variety of undead. Haste will help, but more than that,
focus on the Lich. The rest of the undead aren't nearly as dangerous
as the Lich's spells. Once it goes down you'll get 10000 experience.
Don't celebrate too much, however, as he'll keep respawning
periodically, but with no reward for subsequent killings. Disarm traps
and loot the sarcophagi-especially be sure to grab Terikan's Key from
the sarcrophagus at (x=1400, y=600), or you're not going anywhere.
When done, open the door at (x=1600, y=450) and go up the stairs beyond.

***HoF***
Our friendly Lich will be joined by two Greater Mummies this time
around. The spells they hurl at you are not to be taken lightly, and
they should be occupied in melee, as well as the Lich. Spell-buff your
party, and this time include at least three characters with Greater
Shield of Lathander. This will buy them enough time to engage-one to
each spell caster. Once the three are occupied, bring up your other
three party members and try to take down the Lich quickly, then move
from Greater Mummy to Greater Mummy.

Note from Lee:
Here's a neat trick - go apeshit on the Lich with all but one character,
and send that party member to get the key. When the Lich is dead and
you have the key, go immediately to the next area (x=1600, y=450).
Ignore everything else, just kill the Lich and get the hell out. As long
as you don't advance into the next area (stay by where you entered), you
can rest (if needed) and then return to kill off whatever is left.
Here's what's neat: the Lich will not respawn once you've left his area,
nor will his minions. While this area can be ground (grinded?) for some
experience, it's a very dangerous place to do it, and I absolutely do
not recommend it.

(x=1450, y=500) Bullets of Fire +2 x10

***TRAPS***
(x=1220, y=850)

*1: A humble little amulet that gives a +2 bonus to saves versus
Petrification and Polymorph.
  ---
*2: Like the Black Knight chess piece we found earlier, this White
Bishop summons a 'priest-like ally to heal the party. According to the
description, this ally will 'heal injured party members until they are
at full health, or when the Bishop no longer has any spells to cast.'
I have five Clerics in my party-one area where I will never need help
is the healing department.
  ---
*3: This ring gives a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +10% bonus to Magic
Resistance. For my money, it's no better than a Ring of Protection +2..
but it's not any worse, either. Of course, you can find the latter by
the dozen, but this is a very rare find, indeed.
  ---
*4: You'll need this key to open the door at (x=1400, y=600), which
leads to the Hall of Heroes.
  ---
*5: Yet another one. You now could have as many as three of these
weapons.

Hall of Heroes (AR6006)
o======================================================================o
6) Things are calm for now, but we know that stupid Lich is around
here somewhere. There's also plenty of tombs to loot.. but we need to
smite that Lich, first, so we can get some peace. Head forward and
ignore all the tombs on either side of the hall. Dead ahead you'll find
the Lich again, with an armed retinue. Kill them and, once Terikan is
down, go through the door at (x=750, y=900). Disarm the traps in this
tomb and loot their respective containers. Terikan's Phylactery is
at (x=440, y=980).

***HoF***
There will be more Greater Mummies hiding in tombs in Heart of Fury
mode. It doesn't matter, a lone Greater Mummy is little threat on any
difficulty.

***ITEMS***
(x=440, y=980) Terikan's Phylactery*1
(x=500, y=1050) Terikan's Journal*2, Scroll of Domination,
		Scroll of Chaos*3, Scroll of Antimagic Shell*4

***TRAPS***
(x=440, y=980)
(x=500, y=1050)

*1: You can't destroy the Lich without its phylactery. Never fear,
however, you won't be holding onto it for long.
  ---
*2: A journal detailing the schemes of Terikan. It also mentions trying
to get the door to Wyrm's Tooth open.. but unfortunately, it seems that
this cnanot be done with the forge in its current state.
  ---
*3: This lovely spell is just like the Confusion spell, but it imposes
a -4 save penalty on all foes within its area of effect. We'll get
plenty of spells to compete for 4th-level spell slots, but 5th-level
spells worth anything are rare. This should be your Mage debuff of
choice for the rest of forever.
  ---
*4: A potentially useful defensive spell for our fighting Mages. It
completely protects one from magic, but makes one unable to use any
oneself. Against foes that are magically strong, but physically weak,
it's worth a consideration.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) With the Phylactery in hand head to Jamoth's tomb, which is beyond
the door at (x=1700, y=1100). As soon as you cross the threshold, you'll
gain an experience reward for destroying the Lich. Wee! Now you can
search the rest of the Hall of Heroes without being interrupted
constantly. Loot the tomb you're currently in, then enter the tomb
behind the door at (x=1000, y=1100) and loot hte sarchopagus at
(x=770, y=1250). Before you bother looting anything else, let's return
to Norlinor for a quest reward (don't worry, there's meaning to my
madness). Exit the Hall of Heroes at (x=2000, y=1700).

***REWARD***
(For taking Terikan's phylactery into Jamoth's tomb)
EXP	52500

***ITEMS***
(x=950, y=870) Scroll of Monster Summoning III, Potion of Infravision,
	       Red Potion, Axe of Caged Souls*1
(x=770, y=1250) Reznath's Journal*2

*1: Didn't we already find one of these? Oh well. They really like this
axe.
  ---
*2: Earlier Porlinor suggested that a traitor in their midsts must have
been selling weapons to the Orcs-a matter of individual greed and
treachery, rather than a matter of Dwarven policy as a whole. This
journal, then, seems to be a confession. You'll need to take it in order
to score the best helmet in the game.

Live Forge (AR6013)
o======================================================================o
8) Return to the forge and you'll find that the dead forge has become
a live forge again. Head down the stairs and Norlinor will talk to you
again-thanking you allowing its brothers to sleep again. He'll also
tell you that the key to the door in the Hall of Heroes leading to
Wyrm's Tooth can now be found in the forge (x=1360, y=1130).

***ITEMS***
(x=1360, y=1130) Forge Key*1, The Celebrant's Blade

***REWARD***
(For restoring the forge to working order, allowing the Dwarves to rest)
EXP	84000

*1: This opens the door at (x=500, y400) in the Hall of Heroes (AR6006).
We'll need this key to continue with the game and head to Wyrm's Tooth.
  ---
*2: A Battle Axe +4.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Now that we have the Forge Key, return to the Hall of Heroes and
loot the rest of the tombs. There are traps to be wary of, but by now,
searching for traps before you stick your hands in sarcophagi should be
a standard procedure for you. Behind the door at (x=1220, y=1320) you'll
find a Greater Mummy, so be sure to explore that tomb in force and
smite it before it gets off any nasty spells. Next go through the door
leading to Gaznak's tomb (x=1450, y=850), wherein you'll find his
sarcophagus (x=1660, y=720), which contains the Blessed Helm of
Lathander-the best helmet in the game. Over at (x=1200, y=700) you'll
find the door leading to Evayne's tomb-her statue (x=1050, y=700) stands
out like a sore thumb in a Dwarven tomb (look at the knockers on her!
Larrel should have bred more.) Loot the container in Evayne's tomb
(x=1450, y=470) to find Evayne's Journal.

Note: The Blessed Helm of Lathander will not appear in the sarchopagus
at (x=1660, y=720) until you grab Reznath's Journal and leave the level,
which is why we looted in a somewhat odd way. See? I told you there was
meaning to my madness.

***ITEMS***
(x=2200, y=1070) ~Short Sword of Shadows +3
		 (3rd Play: Hold Fast)
		 (6th play: Bastard Sword +2: Conflaguration)
(x=1200, y=1660) Mail of Life*1
(x=1000, y=1440) Owain's Lullabye*2
(x=1650, y=730) Potion of Insulation
(x=1660, y=720) Blessed Helm of Lathander*3
(x=1450, y=470) Journal of Evayne*4

***TRAPS***
(x=2200, y=1070)
(x=1200, y=1660)
(x=1550, y=750)

*1: It's possible that this is still a decent suit of armor for us to
wear, with a base Armor Class of two. It also gives +10 Hit Points and
allows the wearer to regenerate one Hit Point at the pathetically
slow rate of one Hit Point per turn. A suit of Plate Mail Armor and a
Ring of Protection +2 is still a better combo.
  ---
*2: Another Bardic instrument. I don't have any use for Bards, and
hence, I don't have any use for this item. It can be used to cast a
10d4+10 damage Cone of Cold.
  ---
*3: The best helmet in the game-it gives a two point bonus to Armor
Class and allows the wearer to cast Cure Moderate Wounds, Neutralize
Poison, and Remove Paralysis once per day. Remove Paralysis, as you
may know, is an area-of-effect spell that frees allies from the effects
of paralysis, hold, web, etc. This helmet allows you to dispense with
the use of Rings of Free Action and allow your Boots of the Fox to
work with greater effect.. at least, if you have several of them so
paralyzed allies can be aided by another character wearing this helmet.
A party of six such characters has nothing to fear.. when it comes to
poison and paralysis, at least. Of course, using this item as your
protection from paralysis means you will not be able to use the
multi-web tactic. This helmet can save a character from an unfortunate
Hold Person spell or from a Ghast, but not constant exposure to such
effects. To be fair, however, I never use that tactic after Dragon's
Maw anyways. It's a beginner tactic, when our buffs and Hit Points
are limited, but we have plenty of 2nd-level Mage spell to throw about.
Now that we're higher level, I find that just throwing out a Slow or
Chaos spell ends fights just as well-and it allows us to buff with
Haste.
  ---
*4: This journal recounts Evayne's misplaced hope in Elven-Dwarven
reconciliation, that the tide may be turned against the Orc hordes.
Larrel would like to see this, and know that his daughter wasn't killed
by the Dwarves of Dorn's Deep, don't you think?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Only two tombs remain at the end of the hall. When you explore that
far you'll be attacked by two Bronze Sentries, rough melee foes that
guard the door to Wyrm's Tooth. They require +2 weapons to hit, and can
do some pretty mean damage, especially to characters with a sub-par
Armor Class. Haste is helpful, as are Emotion spells, Prayer, Draw Upon
Holy Might, Recitation.. you should know what works by now. When they're
down, you're done with Dorn's Deep. Go through the door (x=500, y=400)
to reach Wyrm's Tooth.

***HoF***
Now there are four Bronze Sentries, and they pack a whallop. They are
able to quickly cut down any one of my characters.. if I'm foolish
enough to attack without spell-buffs. I'm not, and you're not.
Stoneskin really shines in this fight, as negating initial damage until
one or two of them are dead removes most of the threat from this
encounter.

o======================================================================o

o======================================================================o
|								       |
|			    Glacial Aquarium 			       |
|								       |
o======================================================================o
We fought our way through Dorn's Deep, and although we didn't discover
the source of the evil that plagues Kuldahar, we at least have an
interesting lead. Orogs and Drow were set here to guard this location
from intrusion, and set up the Orog Krilag as the Lieutenant in charge.
There are apparently six of these 'Lieutenants', and what purpose they
serve, we do not yet know. However, if they're all as wretched as
Krilag, we are dealing with some organized evil here. The next of these
lieutenants is in the Wyrm's Tooth Glacier, some being going by the name
of Kreg Frostbeard. Since we have no other leads, we might as well
track down this character.

Wyrm's Tooth, Glacier (AR7005)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK017}
		1) Trolls of Two Colds
		2) The Upper Entrance
		3) The Lower Entrance
		4) Yeticide
		5) Town Run!
		6) Kerish's Emancipation Assassination
		7) Visiting Vera and Exploring the Aquarium
		8) The warm Room
		9) More R.A. Rip-Offs
		10) A Quick Course in Dwarven Engineering
		11) Kerish's Key
		12) Slaying the Slave Leader
		13) Freeing the Slaves
		14) Clearing the Aquarium
		15) To the Frost Giant Caves

1) As soon as you appear in the Glacier you'll be attacked by Greater
Ice Trolls and Snow Trolls. The former are like the Ice Trolls we fought
earlier, while the latter are more of the annoying bastards that can
only be killed for good with fire, acid, or poison. There's not much
strategy involved here, just put them down with melee and missile
attacks, and in the case of the Snow Trolls, keep them down with fire,
acid, or poison. Almost everything in this place will drop gems of some
sort, if you still need money. After the Severed Hand and Dorn's Deep,
however, I have no need of money. Seriously, I had over 200,000 gold at
this point.

Note from Lee:
The Flaming Long Sword +2 is the best possible weapon in the game for
this section. While it has been easily surpassed by better swords as
far as magic bonuses, it kills Trolls and makes them stay killed. Why
waste arrows of fire, acid, etc, if you don't have to?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Continue southeast, then south, smiting Snow Trolls and Greater Ice
Trolls as you go. Eventually you'll come to a chasm bridged by a..
bridge. When you get near the bridge you'll get the following floating
text:

"The bridge is in poor shape and may collapse. You cannot cross it."

Nothing we can do here yet. Go up the stairs to the east and cross a
large, more sturdy stone bridge. Smite an Ettin and turn your gaze to
the north, where an odd building awaits (x=1900, y=1300). We'll explore
this building shortly, but first I want to clear the rest of the
exterior and perhaps find a way back through town that doesn't require
me to go through Dorn's Deep again.

***HoF***
There will be several Ettins here in Heart of Fury mode, instead of just
one.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Head across another stone bridge to the east, then head south,
disposing of Trolls as you go. Travel southwest down some stairs, and
follow the path as it turns west. You'll find yourself under the central
platform that led to the building above, and Trolls abound. Good news!
You can reach the building from here too, through the doors at
(x=2000, y=2200), (x=2150, y=2200) and (x=2300, y=2200). Ignore these
doors, too, and backtrack up to the north.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) From the bridge we crossed earlier, head north up a short flight of
stairs. Eventually you'll come to some more prominent stairs heading
west. Ignore the unexplored north for now and head up the stairs to the
west, then up some more stairs to the north. Atop these stairs you
should encounter some Glacial Yetis. By now, anything that actually
stays dead when we put it down is a welcome change. Go up some more
stairs to the west and kill every overly hairy critter you find, be it
Yeti, Glacial Yeti, or Yeti Chieftain, then head back east. Now head
up to the unexplored northern passage to find an area transition at
(x=3600, y=200).

Crossroads (AR7000)
o======================================================================o
5) Good news! You're done with Chapter 5 already! No, seriously, if you
go into the cave at (x=1100, y=600) Chapter 6 will start. But, we came
to this stupid glacier seeking some lieutenant named Kreg Frostbeard.
We know there are six of them, and we know their badges serve as some
kind of key, so let's not bother skipping to Chapter 6 yet. We can't
open the gate at (x=600, y=200) yet, so don't bother. Instead, exit the
area at (x=1100, y=10) to reach the world map. Huzzah! We can sell off
all the loot we've accumulated. Return to Kuldahar if you wish and sell
off your goodies. Unfortunately, Orrick doesn't have anything new for us
and there's really not much to do here in town. We could also visit
Larrel and give him Evayne's diary, but we'll find more stuff to turn
in there at the end of the chapter, so let's just wait on it. Once
you're done, return to Wyrm's Tooth and enter the building we ignored
so fervently (x=1900, y=1300).

Frozen Aquarium (AR7001)
o======================================================================o
6) When you enter you'll be accosted by some Frost Salamanders. If you
say you want nothing, they'll kick you out.. but at least they didn't
attack! Say you want to see their leader, Kerish (x=3400, y=1000) and
they'll take you to him. This paranoid Frost Salamander seems a bit on
edge about what we can only guess is 'oppressive executive oversight'.
He seems to think we work for Marketh (how else would we get here
unscathed?) He'll also tell you that the old leader, Kreg Frostbeard,
has been replaced by his son, Joril. I guess one anonymous lieutenant
is just as good as another-this information doesn't change our plans.
Finally, ask him why there are corpses strewn all over the place.. you
may have noticed them when you were cleansing the glacier outside of
Trolls. Apparently some slaves managed to escape and fled to a room on
the level below-a room that became too hot for the frosty critters here
to withstand. I suppose something room temperature would be too hot for
arctic beings. In any event, the homocidal frost creatures can't get
down there, but the slaves can't get away, as the exit to the surface
is locked, and Trolls are patrolling the glacier (err.. or rather, they
were). It occurs to Kerish that you, being a fleshy, warm-blooded,
humanoid-type creature, can get at the slaves. Or rather, their leader.
Most of the slaves can be starved out, but their leader has made Kerish
look foolish. Without their leader, the slaves are helpless and will
soon break, so Kerish wants you to find this leader and slay them. Take
it into consideration for now.

***HoF***
If you start any fights in this area, just keep in mind that the Frost
Salamanders now have a lot more staying power, which means a group of
them will deal a good bit of cold damage over the course of a battle.
Also be extra wary of Winter Wolves, whose frozen breath will deal more
damage now. If you have Boots of the North, now is a good time to strap
them on. 50% Cold Resistance will serve you much better than the Boots
of the Fox will.. at least in this chapter. Of course, you can always
just use Resist Fire/Cold and Entropy Shield for absolute protection.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) This is one of the rarest of occurances in this game-we actually have
a choice-two ways to resolve things, one of which we can pick! I know,
it should be a staple of RPGs, but it's surprisingly light in most
games. You can actually find the slave leader now-and despite what
Kerish said, it's not a 'HE' it's a 'SHE'. Vera is at (x=220, y=1250),
although she's not too talkative right now. Why should she be? For all
she knows, we could be working for the Frost Trolls, who she admits to
be hiding from. After all, how the hell else would we make it here?
Despite her unhelpfulness, you can snatch an Amulet of Protection +1
from her, and if you talk to her and ask her to trust you, you'll be
able to get some experience shortly. Besides wasting time talking to
Vera, there's not much to do up here. Be careful when walking around, as
Salamanders have cold auras that will damage you if you're too close.
Their aura continuously 'recast' which prevents you from saving here...
which kind of sucks if you're a compulsive quick-saver, like me.
Anyways, when you're done messing around, head down the stairs at
(x=2350, y=2400).

Warm Room (AR7003)
o======================================================================o
8) This is where those pesky quasi-hairless apes fled! You can find
Gareth at (x=1420, y=300), who will tell you about their harrowing
escape from the Frost Salamanders who had enslaved them. This used to
be some odd aquarium before it froze over, and if you're wondering who
would build an aquarium in a glacier.. well, we must assume that these
tanks were once heated, right? Apparently a slave named Vera managed to
sneak into a control room and turn on some of the surviving heating
devices (she's sneaky, see, which is why she has a Thief character
sprite.) This room was reheated, and the slaves fled here before the
Frost Salamanders could block the area off; now they're at an impasse.
When you get the option, say "Gareth, I have seen Vera", which you can
do since you talked to her. This will net you some experience. Anyways,
continue asking about their troubles and he'll explain the problem: the
Frost Salamanders can't get to them, but the slaves can't escape, or get
food and water. The good news? They've found a way out, but they need a
key, which they suspect is possessed by Kerish. So we have our conflict
of interests, do we kill Kerish for his key and free the slaves, or do
we kill the leader of the slaves for Kerish?

***REWARD***
(For telling the slaves that Vera is still alive)
EXP	60000

***ITEMS***
(x=1330, y=300) Note to Kerish

*1: Just a friendly letter from Joril to Kerish, reminding him of who
is boss. No wonder we didn't see any Frost Salamanders outside..
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) While we decide, head to the western side of the level, where you can
find Soth (x=100, y=330). He just so happens to be from a village near
Auckney, which is, of course, another reference to an R.A. Salvatore
book. Compare this exerpt from 'Spine of the World'...:

"Like Auckney itself, a village of two hundred people that rarely showed
up on any maps.."

..to what Soth says:

"I hail from a small village outside of Auckney... Auckney's located at
the other end of the Spine of the World mountains. Anyway, my village is
a small place. I don't think it's made it on the maps yet..."

If Auckney, with 200 people, is big enough that he refers to it as a
reference for where his village is, his village must be absolutely
tiny. Anyways, it's just shameless pandering to people who have read
Forgotten Realms books. If Elminster can be in Baldur's Gate, why not
a dozen R.A. Salvatore tie-ins in Icewind Dale? Why make a game based
off the Forgotten Realms if you're not going to use its locations and
characters? Then again, why make something of your own if you're going
to marry it to somebody else's story? Anyways, enough of that, I've
ranted enough.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Anyways, Soth fancies himself a scholar, and if you ask him what
he's doing here, he'll tell you that in his research he discovered that
this complex was a temple dedicated to Dugmaren Brightmantle, a somewhat
silly Dwarven god who is rightfully disdained for inspiring people to
build aquariums in glaciers. Finally, ask about the books here, and
wonder of wonders-there's a book here that just so happens to detail
Dwarven engineering! And by Dwarven engineering, they mean 'repairing
rope bridges that no Dwarf would be caught dead crossing.' Ask about
learning to repair the bridge by reading the books here and you'll gain
a juicy experience reward and an Engineering Manual, which you should
keep your hands on.

***REWARD***
(For recieving a book on how to fix the Wyrm's Tooth bridge)
EXP	112500
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Head back up to the aquarium and ask Kerish for the key the slaves
need. Either option will work, he's so paranoid about who you work for
that he apparently has no will to contest you in this matter. When you
have it, you'll gain some experience. Now that you've gone this far, the
time has come to make a choice. To help Kerish or the slaves? It doesn't
really matter, the experience rewards are the same. If get the key, kill
Vera, then try to recover the slaves you'll get 200,000 experience. If
you get the key, kill Vera, then free the slaves anyways, you'll get
200,000 experience. Finally, if you get the key, free the slaves, then
talk to Vera, you'll get.. 200,000 experience. The only difference?
Vera drops Leather Armor +2, a Dagger +2, and an Amulet of Protection +1
(if you didn't steal it previously). If you free the slaves at any
point, you'll have to (get to) fight all the critters in the aquarium,
which are collectively worth a bit of experience, and Kerish will drop
the Spear of Kerish. So do what you will, although for my money, I'd
rather kill everything in the aquarium.

***REWARD***
(For receiving the key from Kerish)
EXP	60000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) If you want to help Kerish, go talk to Vera and get her to admit
that she's the leader of the slaves, then kill her. She'll drop some
Leather Armor +2, a Dagger +2, and an Amulet of Protection +1 if you
didn't steal it already. Return to Kerish and tell him you killed
Vera for some quest experience. Now, if you want to free the slaves-or
if you sided with Kerish and want to enslave them again, head back
down the the Warm Room (AR7003).

***REWARD***
(For killing Vera, the leader of the slaves)
EXP	80000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) Whether you're helping the slaves or not, it's time to talk to
Gareth. If you give him the key you got from Kerish (which you can do
whether you killed Vera or not, earlier) the slaves will gleefully
flee and you'll get some quest experience and all the creatures in the
aquarium will turn hostile (again, even if you killed Vera earlier). If
you tell the slaves to get back to their life of toil and degredation,
Gareth proudly proclaims they'd rather die. Which they will facilitate
by attacking you. One way or another, there will no slaves left in this
room when you're done.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
14) Now, we're ready to make our brave showdown with Kerish. If you're
a pussy and sided with him.. well, just walk up and tell him the slaves
are no more for some experience. Otherwise, spell-buff in the Warm Room
before heading up the stairs (x=500, y=100), where the slaughter will
begin immediately. If you boost all your Clerics will Resist Fire/Cold
you'll reduce the damage you take from the cold the enemies will use
in various forms-either the cold aura from the Frost Salamanders, or
the breath of the Winter Wolves. Slaughter your way through the level-
once spell-buffed brute force should make clearing the level a simple
endeavor, and if you're getting too beat up, just return to the Warm
Room, rest, rebuff, and return. You have two goals here-talk to Vera
and tell her you freed the slaves for some juicy experience, and kill
Kerish. Of course, be sure to loot Kerish for his spear*1, the gems
most critters drop, and the Winter Wolf's pelt.

***REWARD***
(For emancipating the slaves.. from life)
EXP	60000

***REWARD***
(For giving Gareth the key to exit)
EXP	60000

***REWARD*** (GOOD)
(For freeing the slaves and putting Vera's mind at ease)
EXP	80000

*1: A +3 Spear that gives the wearer +10% Fire Resistance and a 5%
chance of dealing 1d6 cold damage.

Note from Lee:
You can also, of course, take the 'kill everything' route: kill Vera,
kill the slaves, return to Kerish for the lesser experience, and then
kill him and his minions anyway to make up the difference. Your call...
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
15) Well, that little problem has been resolved one way or the other.
Now it's time to leave the aquarium and return to the rope bridge we
couldn't cross earlier. When you get near it you'll get an experience
reward and the bridge will be repaired:

"The bridge is in poor shape but you manage to repair it using the
engineering manual."

That engineering manual must have contained lumber and rope, eh? Cross
the bridge and enter the cave at (x=350, y=2250).

***REWARD***
(For repairing the bridge)

We've dealt with them by now-they're not too much of a threat. Hasting
up and casting Resist Fire/Cold is a good idea, since their breath
weapons can score some cheap damage, and there are a good number of
them here. There's a cave to the north at (x=3400, y=2100), but we'll
ignore it for now.

***HoF***
I didn't find this area any more challenging to my Heart of Fury party
than it was to my original play-through party. The Winter Wolves can do
some cheap damage, but the Frost Giants aren't very powerful-at least
not compared to the Bronze Sentries we fought earlier. Keep Haste on and
you'll be fine.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Continue west until you come to a wider chamber. In a cubby to the
northeast you'll find some 'White Wyrms'. Whether these are supposed to
be adult White Dragons before Bioware/Black Isle had the balls to make a
REAL Dragon later, or whether they're supposed to be adolscent Dragons
is anybody's guess, although if it's the latter, they should be called
'Wyrmlings'. In my fantasy lexicon, a Wyrm isn't just another word for
Dragon-a Wyrm is a very large, very old Dragon, specifically. Yes, it
matters! Anyways, one of these creatures is called 'Frostbite', and will
talk to you a bit-although it's not too interesting. Don't tell it to
stop eating people, or it'll take offense at you. We'll let the things
live for now, but do be sure to loot their nests for some... rather
nice loot, really. See? What Dragon would let you steal from it? A
young, stupid one, or something that's not really a Dragon! Continue
west from their nest and loot a shrine. What a generous chamber this is!

***ITEMS***
(x=2800, y=1970) 246 gold, Fire Agate Gem x2, Skydrop Gem x1,
		 Iol Gem x2, Moonstone Gem x1, Star Diopside Gem x1,
		 Diamond x2, Pearl x1
(x=2870, y=1900) 715 gold, Gold Ring, Fire Opal Ring,
		 Mythril Field Plate Armor +2*1, Broken Armor,
		 Long Bow of Marksmanship*2, The Cittern of War*3
(x=1900, y=1950) Potion of Power, Potion of Healing x2, Red Potion,
		 Gauntlets of Infernal Damnation*4, Ring of Holiness*5,
		 Scroll of Symbol of Pain

*1: Holy hot damn! Another one! This replaces the Mail of Life on
Nauzhir the Red.
  ---
*2: Doesn't this bow seem familiar? I could swear this thing was in
Baldur's Gate... anyways, it's a +3 THAC0 bow that deals +2 damage.
We've certainly found better bows a long time ago.
  ---
*3: Another Bardic toy-it casts Emotion: Courage on the user. Couldn't
a Bard cast that spell on their own by now?
  ---
*4 The name pretty much says it all. When worn, the wearer is engulfed
in a Shroud of Flame.
  ---
*5: This baby grants an extra spell slot from 1st-4th level. I put this
on my party leader, out of sheer favoritism. I figure if I play the
game through six times, everybody will get a shot at one of these rings,
right?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Leave this room via a western passage along the southwestern edge
of the area. This passage is blocked by two gigantic.. uh.. giants. You
can talk to them, but they prove unhelpful and rather easily-provoked.
Continue past them until you come across Joril-this new lieutenant we've
heard about. He is, like all giants easy to pick a fight with. It'll
probably come to that eventually, but there are more lucrative ways to
interact with him. For example, you can get him to hand over his badge
if you have a Charisma of 12 or more.. or, if you pick dialogue options
#1, #2, #3, #1, #1, #1. This nets you a great deal of experience. After
this you can ask him how he killed his father-apparently Joril struck a
deal with the Wyrms we met earlier, and in return, he's been feeding the
creatures slaves. Are these slaves good for ANYTHING save feeding the
creatures in the glacier? Once you end the conversation with Joril
you'll get ANOTHER experience reward. That's right, it's a two-for, one
reward for tricking him, and other for getting the badge. Score.

Note: If you have a Paladin in your party, they will demand the release
of the slaves after Joril mentions the 'sacrifices'. This will net you
an experience reward, but it will, obviously, expose you. Apparently
whomever Joril thinks you represent aren't big into liberation.

***REWARD***
(For tricking Joril)
EXP	80000

***REWARD***
(For obtaining Joril's badge)
EXP	80000

***REWARD***
(For revealing yourself to Joril)
EXP	180000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Now, we have the badge, but there's more we can do here-and there's
no need to pick a fight with Joril just yet. We have the run of the
place, so why not explore? He DID mention some slaves, right? Who wants
to bet they'd rather be freed than eaten by some Wyrms? Continue west
and you'll come to the chamber where the giants keep kip. There's plenty
of looting to be done, and we might as well do it now since we don't
have to fight for it. Head north through the chamber and grab everything
that's not bolted down.

***ITEMS***
(x=150, y=1750)	Potion of Healing x2, Potion of Heroism,
		Scroll of Raise Dead
(x=600, y=1820) Potion of Insulation, Potion of Invisibility.
(x=300, y=1350) Potion of Fortitude, Potion of Genius,
		wand of the Heavens, Scroll of Insect Plague
(x=1420, y=1250) Potion of Master Thievery, Potion of Mind Focusing
(x=300, y=900) Potion of Cold Resistance, Potion of Fire Breath,
	       Scroll of Spike Stones, Dagger of Venom*1
(x=400, y=650) Potion of Clarity, Potion of Cloud Giant Strength,
	       Cloak of Protection +2*2, Scroll of Champion's Strength
(x=430, y=630) Potion of Absorption, Potion of Agility,
	       Leather Armor +2, Dagger +2: Longtooth*3
(x=1100, y=550) Oil of Speed, Elixer of Health, Blur Deck*4,
		Scimitar +3: Frostbrand*5
(x=900, y=1100) Potion of Invulnerability, Potion of Magic Shielding,
		Darts of Stunning x13

*1: The Dagger of Venom is a decent weapon, I just dont have any use
for it. It would have needed to have made an appearance much sooner.
It's a +2 weapon that has a chance to poison an enemy for six points
of damage per round.
  ---
*2: I find it hard to wear this, what with all the magical armor I have.
If you really need a ring slot empty, you can replace a Ring of
Protection +2 with this cloak. Honestly, however, Mithran's Cloak is
superior.
  ---
*3: Another decent weapon I don't have room for. A dagger with 1d6 base
damage.. Eh, Dagger of venom is still better.
  ---
*4: Can it really hurt to have another? Sure, it'll become useless when
we all have Shimmering Sashes.. or when all my Mages can cast Blur,
but it can go on one of the heavy armor wearers in the mean time.
  ---
*5: Did you really think you'd get through Icewind Dale without finding
Drizzt's future scimitar? It's better than the Flaming Longsword +2, at
least. It's a +3 Scimitar that gives its wielder +50% Fire Resistance.

Note from Lee:
The Wand of the Heavens is one of my all-time favorite items, calling
a 6d8 flamestrike on a single target at a range of 120 ft (save for
half damage).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) When you hit the northen edge of the chamber turn east. You'll find
another tunnel to ignore at (x=1800, y=700), we're more interested in
what lies south of here. Speaking of which, you'll find a Frost Giant
elegantly named Gorg at (x=2150, y=1150). He'll just tell you what you
already know-he guards the slaves, the slaves get fed to Frostbite.
More interestingly, Davin is over at (x=1670, y=1400). It's great that
all the slaves in this game have one concise leader and no conflicting
opinions. Talk to him and assure him you don't serve the giants and he
will gab about the giant skeleton to the east (which, if you've followed
this guide, you haven't seen yet), the giants, and the cavern. Now that
I've covered the boring stuff, ask him what he's doing here (just in
case he hasn't assumed we're complete morons yet.) He'll tell you what
you already know-they're slaves, and they're being eaten-before asking
you to go kill the higher rung on the food chain.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Backtrack to the generous chamber where you found Frostbite and his
fellow Wyrms earlier. Talk to Frostbite and tell it that the whole
eating people thing is over.. or just attack it. It's fairly tough in
melee combat compared to most foes we've been fighting, but leading with
my well-protected party leader he doesn't have a chance to do much
before he's chopped down. Then just deal with his fellow Wyrms, which
are a good bit weaker than Frostbite.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Return to Davin and tell him the beast is dead for an obscenely huge
experience reward. It's hard to be evil in video games when developers
keep giving us such incentive for helping people. Anyways, their dinner
buddies might be dead, but these slaves are still stuck in a glacier
full of Frost Giants who are none-too-friendly. Fortunately, Davin knows
of two ways out of here-through the Giant's domain, or through some
small tunnels (the two tunnels we ignored thus far!). So, either kill
all the giants, or clear the 'hazards' that might be in the as-of-yet
unexplored tunnels. Since it gives us a reasonable excuse to explore
the unexplored, let's do the latter..

***REWARD***
(For killing Frostbite, saving Davin and the other slaves)
EXP	420000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) Go through the tunnel at (x=1800, y=700) and kill the Yetis you'll
find yourself in the midst of. Once they're all dead, spell-buff as
much as you can-Prayer, Draw Upon Holy Might, Recitation, Haste,
Emotion: Hope, Emotion: Courage, Protection from Evil 10' Radius, and
all that good stuff, then continue south until you find Kontik
(x=2630, y=1600) and the Black Ice Knights who accompany her. She's
another nutter who worships Auril, and has come seeking revenge for
killing Lysan earlier. There are so many ways to win this fight.. pelt
her with a barrage of Greater Command, or even Silence 15' Radius. My
favorite tactic? Just rush her with your fully-buffed party and watch
her explode into a pathetic pile of gore. Her Black Ice Knights are more
of a threat than she is (although I suppose she could be more of a
threat if she actually got any spells off). Interesting note, did you
know she has an Intelligence score of 20? Why, I can't say, it certainly
isn't an attribute that helps in combat in 2nd Edition. When all is
still, loot her for a random gem, a Robe of the Evil Archmagi*1, a Ring
of Protection +2*2, Kontik's Ring of Wizardry*3, Breath of Auril*4, and
a random weapon, as follows:

(1st Play: Static Short Sword +3*5)
(3rd Play: Two Handed Sword +3: Bane*6)
(6th Play: Long Sword +3: Enforcer*7)
(7th Play: Bastard Sword of Greater Phasing*8)

(x=2500, y=1550) Scroll of Chain Lightning*9, Barrel of Pure Water*10,
		 Scroll of Globe of Invulnerabiltiy*11
		 Potion of Mirrored Eyes
(x=2390, y=1650) Scroll of Otiluke's Freezing Sphere*12,
    		 Potion of Regeneration, Potion of Stone Form,
		 Potion of Storm Giant Strength

Note from Lee:
I keep the party situated to the north, in the ex-Yeti area, and draw
the Black Ice Knights up to me to die 1-2 at a time. Once they're gone,
I go after Auril, who is now alone and defenseless. Also, because I am
out of the range of enemies, I can save in between battles. Again, no
buffs are required (although Haste can't hurt); I took almost no damage
at all in this fight...

*1: Veterans of Baldur's Gate know of these things-they give the same
Armor Class as Chain Mail, +5% Magic Resistance, and a +1 bonus to
Saves. Unfortunately, I'm more on the good side of things, so I have
no use for these robes.
  ---
*2: Another one. We already don't have enough room for these things.
  ---
*3: This. Is. Nice. Doubles 1st and 2nd level spells, and increases cold
damage you deal by 15%. Who cares about the cold damage, doubled spells
makes this awesome. I give this to Syrenil, since she's been my utility
Mage throughout the game-casting Identify, Burning Hands, Mirror Image,
and Knock. Eventually my Mages will get up to seven 1st and 2nd Mage
spells, which is enough without this ring.
  ---
*4: A +3 Dagger that gives a +1 Intelligence bonus, a -1 Charisma
penalty, 100% Cold Resistance, -50% Fire Resistance, and allows the
user to cast Cone of Cold twice per day.
  ---
*5: A +3 Short Sword that always does a 1d4 electrical damage and gives
the wearer a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
  ---
*6: This sword is a +3 specimen that has a 25% chance to inflict foes
with disease and gives the wielder +10% Magic Resistance.
  ---
*7: A would-be 'mage' sword, obviously designed to be used by the
enterprising Fighter/Mage. It's a +3 Long Sword with 5% Magic Resistance
and bonus 1st and 2nd spell slots. Unfortunately, I'd rather have
something like a defending weapon or an action weapon on a Fighter/Mage
(armor class and bonus attacks are always welcome) and 1st and 2nd
level spell slots aren't exactly mind-blowing. In any event, none of
my melee Fighters can use this, and Syrenil will find better.. should
she deign to use a melee weapon, anyways.
  ---
*8: A +3 Bastard Sword that has a 15% chase of phasing foes.
  ---
*9: This is a nifty-if not party friendly-6th level offensive spell.
For added shock (pun intended) you can light up groups of enemies before
wading in with your melee fighters. This goes to my Fighter/Mage/Thief.
  ---
*10: Valestis over at the Severed Hand would love to get this for the
Arboretum. Keep it handy.
  ---
*11: This spell blocks all 1st-4th level Mage spells. While not
terribly useful now, in Heart of Fury you'll regret it every time you
let a Mage cast Magic Missile, Melf's Acid Arrow, or Flame Arrow.
  ---
*12: A single-target direct-damage spell. It deals 3-6 points of damage
to a target per level of the caster, although it risks missing entirely
on a successful save. You'll be fighting tons of fire critters shortly,
but this spell, like all damage-dealing spells, fails in Heart of Fury
mode.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) We're not done yet. Head north from Kontik's camp, through the bones
of the quite-dead giant wyrm, and continue north, then east, and
finally south. There are gobs of Trolls (Greater Ice Trolls and Snow
Trolls), so have something firey or acidey on hand to keep the latter
down. Once all the Trolls have been smote, you can exit to the
beginning of the level at (x=3400, y=1600) or return back to the slave
camp (x=2100, y=700).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Return to the slave pens. You can report to Davin for a journal
update, if you wish, but it's time to deal with Gorg. Either provoke
him in conversation, or just manually attack him. Either way, once he's
dead talk to Gavin for another suitably huge quest reward. Now, there's
only one bit of unfinished business left here-time to deal with Joril.

***REWARD***
(For clearing a path for Davin and the slaves to escape)
EXP	180000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Bring yourself before Joril again and spell-buff to the max. Not
because he's terribly dangerous, but there are lots of Winter Wolves
and Frost Giants around, and routing them all will be much easier with
some buffs. Talk to Joril and casually mention that you're here to
kill his face, and a fight begins. After they're dead, you can kill the
two guards you passed and take the others out at your leisure. When
Joril dies he'll drop a Black Opal Gem x1, Chain Mail +2, Joril's Axe*1,
a random weapon, which will be listed at the end of this paragraph, and,
if you already didn't have it, his badge. Note that you will still get
an experience reward for claiming his badge, even if you didn't trick it
off of him earlier.

Note from Lee:
Instead of returning to Joril and then backtracking, I simply head north
and continue counter-clockwise, killing giants as I go. I'll eventually
reach Joril, but he's just another giant as far as I'm concerned.

(1st Play: Redemption*2)
(3rd Play: Fire Flail +3*3)
(6th Play: Giant's Sleep*4)

*1: Joril's Axe is a +3 specimen that gives a +1 bonus to Constitution
and a -1 penalty to Dexterity. If you're that big, I guess agility
isn't too important.
  ---
*2: A +4 War Hammer that dispels Charm and Dire Charm effects on
creatures hit. Honest, I prefer Dispel Magic, myself.
  ---
*3: It would be absolutely wonderful if you could score this weapon
here, as it's a +3 Flail that has a 50% chance of dealing +2d6 Fire
Damage.. the best Troll-killer weapon my party can use. If not, you
won't get a chance to get another one of these until Trials of the
Luremaster.. where it's a guaranteed drop.
  ---
*4: Despite its name, it's just a +3 War Hammer.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Joril might be dead, but there's still plenty of killing to do.
Explore the cavern to the west where the Frost Giants lurk and go on a
massive quest of giant destruction. Kill them and take their loot.. and
their little dogs, too. You're finally done in Wyrm's Tooth. Return to
town and sell off all the goodies you've found (I know I'm overly
stocked on gems and Winter Wolf pelts.. even though I don't need the
money anymore.) Then head to the Severed Hand. We should finally talk to
Larrel and Valestis. The former should know about his daughter's demise,
and the latter will want that Barrel of Pure Water we found in Wyrm's
Tooth to restore the Arboretum. Both will result in a good bit of
experience for us. Once our party is rested, their inventories empty,
and enjoying a good bit of quest experience, it's time to travel to
Wyrm's Tooth on the world map, which will put us back in (AR7000). Go
into the tunnel we ignored earlier at (x=1100, y=600). Once you do,
Chapter 5 is over and Chapter 6 begins. Now, to let everybody know how
things are going, here are my party stats at the end of Chapter 5. Note
that my average Armor Class went from -2 before I fought Yxunomei to
-7 now. Nice.

***REWARD***
(For restoring water to the Arboretum)
EXP	120000

***REWARD***
(For giving Evayne's diary from Dorn's Deep to Larrel)
EXP	56000

o======================================================================o
We've claimed another badge and smote another monstrous lieutenant. But
for all that, it doesn't really feel like we've made any progress, does
it? Sure, we cleared out the Wyrm's Tooth glacier, but at the end of the
day, we still only have a few more notes and another name-'Marketh'-to
go on. Still, we know that there are at least four more lieutenants out
there, so we've got our work cut out for us.

Smelter (AR8001)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK019}
		1) Smithing Salamander and Sentries
		2) Whispers of Cut Quests
		3) Meeting Mutilated Midgets
		4) Killing Kelly & Co.
		5) Smiting Seth
		6) Silence Shriekers
		7) Callard and Son
		8) Fleezum
		9) Battered Ginafae
		10) Thieves and Potatoes
		11) Flozum
		12) Meeting Marketh

1) The lower level of Dorn's Deep-this must be where the Dwarves
retreated after their original home was overrun by Orcs and undead.
Judging from the current residents, however, it didn't do them much
good. As you'd expect from all the lava, Salamanders abound (the good
old fire ones, not the ice freaks from before). Also you'll be playing
with Tarnished Sentries, golems that enjoy throwing axes at you, and
aren't fooled by stealth. Don't worry, though. They're nowhere near as
tough as the Bronze Sentries were, earlier. I start out the level by
buffing, adding Resist Fire/Cold to my normal slew of spells to reduce
the passive fire damage that Salamanders will do as I fight them. There
are plenty of critters to the east (before the bridges) to the west
(near the smelters) and to the north (near an elevator). Clear those
out first, head back up to the glacier and rest, then return back down
here, ready to explore.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Now, for a rather detailed aside.. There was supposed to be a
possessed suit of armor, named 'The Voice of Durdel Anatha' in this
level, a former Paladin of Torm that tried to discover what tore the
Dwarves of Dorn's Deep and the Elves of the Hand of the Seldarine apart.
Discovering the answer to this question (which we'll do shortly) would
have freed him and allowed us to claim a reward from Sister Calliana
back in Kuldahar. It also would have involved Brother Harken, another
one of the lieutenants, whose role as it stands is painfully two-
dimensional. Just for fun, here are the rewards you COULD have obtained,
if these quests actually were left in the game:

If you were a Cleric, Paladin, or Fighter:

The Glory of Suffering
o--------------------o
Armor Class: -3
Special: The wearer's maximum hit points are reduced by 25. While
         wearing the armor, the wearer has a +10% bonus to resist all
         Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning, and Missile attacks.
Weight: 80
Not Usable By:
 Evil or Neutral characters
 Druid
 Mage
 Thief
 Bard

If you were a Ranger or Thief:

Studded Leather Armor
o-------------------o
Armor Class: 2
Dexterity: -1
Special:  -25% to all Thief skills
Weight: 35
Only Usable By:
 Thief (Single, Dual-, and Multi-Class)

If you were a Bard or Druid:

Cloak of Burdened Spirits
o-----------------------o
Weight: 80
Wisdom: +1
Only Usable By:
  Good characters

If you were a Mage:

Robes of Agony
o------------o
Armor Class:  5
Special:  User is always under the effects of a Symbol of Pain, as
	  though being pierced by thorns at all times. +15 hit points
	  while equipped.
Weight: 35
Only Usable By:
 Good characters
 Cleric (Single, Dual-, and Multi-)
 Mage (Single, Dual-, and Multi-)

As you can see, none of these items were really worth anything, except
maybe The Glory of Suffering. These were all probably cut due to time
constraints, but they could just as easily have been cut to lessen the
sheer stupidity of putting these items in the game.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) If you talk to any of the Svirneblin (deep Gnomes-Dwarves by another
name, really. Anybody could compare Belwar and find they match up pretty
well) and they'll mention Marketh. Surprise of surprises, we seem to
have ended up near his domain. From the entrance platform head south-
east until you find some mine tracks. At a cart head north to find a
tower-but don't dally around, as archers within will be assholes and
shoot at you. They don't need an attack role to do it, either-you stand
near the tower, you'll take damage. Over at (x=3380, y=2080) you'll find
a 'Slave Girl' named Fengla. Talk to her and she'll give you the key
to the tower behind us. Now that we can pay those friendly archers a
visit, let's do so (x=2950, y=1850). You might want to spell-buff a bit
before going in, however.

Tower (AR8002)/(AR8014)
o======================================================================o
4) Inside the tower are a number of archers, whom are quite capable of
causing me harm, despite my Armor Class. A Hold Monster fixes things, as
does a Chaos spell, but it's a little too tight for a Greater Command.
Once they're dead, their leader, "Kelly" has Full Plate Armor +1*1,
while all of the archers have Arrows of Piercing. The slave girl who
gave you the key will show up and thank you for freeing her and you'll
get an experience reward. Go through the door at (x=200, y=200) to find
the room where these guards slept. Kudos to you, you've found a safe
haven here, and can rest freely and safely.

***HoF***
You can expect to take more damage this time around, and the archers
within can be pretty lethal once you enter the tower, but I didn't
require a strategy any more refined than a simple Haste spell.

***REWARD***
(For capturing the watchtower and freeing Fengla)
EXP	80000

*1: With an Armor Class of 0, it's just as good as Mithril Field
Plate +2, although it weighs half as much, if that's an issue for you.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Exit the tower (x=450, y=400) and head east, you'll see an innocent
little ramp running north, then northwest. Follow it until you reach a
tiled platorm. Save your game, for we've an opportunity to score
ourselves some loot if we use some tactics and have just a bit of luck.
Up some stairs to the north you'll find the entrance to Marketh's
Palace.. but he's got a little Halfling Thief named Seth guarding the
door (x=3100, y=680). If he spots you, he'll ask you some questions
about some papers. To satsify him, you have several options. First, pick
dialogue option #1. Then, if you're a Halfling you can play the kin
card. Most sane people, however, will have to resort to saying they
worked for the Kraken Society (not the dumb dialogue option with "the
good old "Kraken Days.") which requires an Intelligence or Charisma of
thirteen or higher. Answer three questions 1) Purple, 2) Marketh,
3) Ilmater, and he'll let you pass and run away. If you mess up, he'll
summon some Thieves to attack you, and run away. It's that run away bit
we must avoid-but if you kill him without talking to him (using Web to
hold him in place, then auto-attacking, or a well-placed backstab) the
game will freeze. So we're going to have to be.. more inventive. Cast
invisibility on the entirity of your party (sans one character) and
surround Seth. Then with the visible character, talk to him. When he
goes hostile, give him everything you've got-he's not very strong, and
he can't get away! When he dies he'll drop Studded Leather Armor +2,
Small Shield +1, The Salamander's Tongue*1, and Gauntlets of Elven
Might*2. Once he goes hostile, a host of Thieves will attack, so be
prepared for backstabs.

Note: If you don't kill Seth here, he'll show up again when you confront
Marketh.

***HoF***
I didn't find these thieves to be nearly as lethal as I feared. Sure,
you can get hit for 80 damage by a sneak attack, but compared to the
Fire Giants later on.. it's not that threatening.

*1: A +3 Dagger that give +10% Fire Resistance, a +3 bonus to Saves vs.
Poison, have a 20% chance to deal +1d4 fire damage, and puts the wearer
under the effects of Non-Detection.
  ---
*2: These would almost be decent..they can only be used by dual-or-
multi-classed Fighters, and they set your Strength at 18/51 regardless
of what your real strength is. Otherwise, +1 Armor Class and saves is
good business. I did find a way around this restriction. If you equip
them on a character who is also wearing the Girdle of Stromnos-making
sure to equip the girdle second-your Strength will be set to 19. We'll
find the Girdle of Stromnos a bit later on.

Old Dorn's Palace, Antechamber (AR8005)
o======================================================================o
6) It would seem like the natural thing to do would be to go into the
palace in front of which Seth stood. And this time, the natural thing
to do is the right thing to do. Spell-buff up and head inside
(x=3200, y=600). Your first task in this area is to kill the Shriekers
(noisy mushrooms) lying about. They'll constantly summon Blind
Minotaurs, Salamanders, and Boneguard Skeletons, which makes them
annoying, if not threatening. The Shriekers can be found at
(x=1200, y=1050), (x=1200, y=850), (x=1350, y=700), (x=1620, y=700),
(x=1850, y=800), (x=1850, y=1000), (x=1650, y=1150), and
(x=1400, y=1150).. go northeast from where you enter, you'll find them
encircling a statue. There are also Red Myconids about-and we know
what that means.. it's a searing Salamander smite! A blind bull-brain
battle-axe bearing Boneguard beatdown! A mega moaning mushroom massacre!
I love alliteration.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Anyhow, when you're done recovering from a fit of admiration at my
literary finesse (ignore all the typos and the fact that I abuse commas)
Talk to Callard at (x=1550, y=900) and ask him about the sculpture.
He'll make a joke and give you a 'Portrait of Marketh', drawn by one of
Marketh's goons named Flozem. Righ. Once that's done head through the
doorway at (x=1600, y=300).

***ITEM FISHING***
It's been a while since we've done this, hasn't it? One might even
think I had forgotten. Not so! Most of the drops in the last two
walkthrough sequences were static, and when they weren't your options
sucked. Anyways, the next area contains some of the best Morning Stars
in the game-and hence, some of the best blunt weapons in the game. Plus,
it's a really easy run to make, if you go with a character who has a
decent Armor Class. Open the door at (x=700, y=750) and search the chest
at (x=320, y=820).

Old Dorn's Palace, Level 1 (AR8006)
o======================================================================o
8) There are thieves sneaking around here, with only one goal-to
backstab your party. I send my Ilnathias first, to draw them out. The
Thieves don't really have an answer for a -13 Armor Class. Beyond the
doors at (x=700, y=700) is Fleezum-the guy in the red armor. Talking to
him will result in a fight, which is just fine. He's a powerful Fighter,
but he's only one powerful Fighter against a party. When he dies, he'll
drop 44 gold, a helmet,  Bathed-In-Blood*1, a Large Shield +1 and a Long
Sword +1.

***ITEMS***
(x=320, y=820) Short Sword, Bastard Sword, Mace,
	       ~Star-Forged War Hammer +4*2
	       (3rd Play: Sanctified War Hammer +3)
	       (4th Play: Static Star +3*3)
	       (6th Play: Morning Star +4: Defender*4)
	       (7th Play: Morning Star of the Gods*5)
(x=400, y=650) Potion of Cloud Giant Strength x2, Potion of Agility,
	       Oil of Speed

*1: This is one of the most protective suits of armor in the game, with
a base Armor Class of -1. I put it on Amirule, who gives Mithran's
Cloak to Eraithul, who ditches the Ring of Protection +2.
  ---
*2: A +4 War Hammer with 10% magic resistance and +2 save versus spells.
  ---
*3: A +3 Morning Star that has a 15% chance to inflict slow and a 25%
chance to deal 2d3 electrical damage.
  ---
*4: It took a while, but here it is. A +4 Morning Star that gives +2 to
Armor Class, +15% magic resistance, and 20% Slashing and Piercing
Resistance. A highly enchanted weapon with great defensive bonuses, too?
Yes please. One of my Fighter/Mage/Clerics is set for the rest of
the game.
  ---
*5: Despite its epic name, this is a +3 Morning Star that gives a +1
bonus to Armor Class, a +1 bonus to Wisdom, and allows the user to
memorize two additional first level spells and one additional second
level spell. It's still nice, but it's only marginally better than
the Sanctified Morning Star +3 we found back in the Severed Hand.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Leave Fleezum's room and head southeast to find the door to
Ginafae's room (x=950, y=1100). Talk to Ginafae (x=700, y=1190) and ask
about her face. She will give you the cliche excuse given by battered
women everywhere. If you promise not to kill her boyfriend, she'll tell
you about about Poquelin, who is apparently the ring-leader of this
whole operation. She'll babble on about the lieutenant's badges, an
invisible barrier in a fallen temple, and how it's somehow not Marketh's
fault that he does bad things.. it.. it's the evil temptation that MAKES
him! She will also talk about how she came to be here-she'll ring out
that name 'Malavon' again, who is apparently her brother, and some
'Maiden Ilmadia'. She can't leave, however, due to some spells placed on
her by her brother. If only there were some way to remove them..
Anyways, she'll throw a tantrum if we kill her boyfriend, and there is
a quest reward for us if we help her out. We'll take her position.. into
consideration.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Well, that was annoying. Cross the hallway to the north to find
another door (x=1300, y=700), beyond which lies a mess hall. You can
expect some more Thieves here (they're usually not in rooms, which is
why I note these ones). I know if I had to defend anything, it would be
the food. Seriously, that's not a joke. Fat people are like that. Open
another door at (x=1700, y=700) to find the kitchen. Inside is a
useless cook and a table we can loot (x=1800, y=700), for a Sack of
Potatoes. Potatoes? Yes, we'll need them for a quest in a while.

***ITEMS***
(x=1800, y=700) Sack of Potatoes*1

*1: A quest item. You know the drill, keep them on hand until somebody
just so happens to ask for them.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Leave the kitchen and cross the hall again, this time to the south.
Kill whatever Thieves show up and open the door at (x=1500, y=1200). In
this room you'll find Flozum, Fleezum's brother. He's a bit nicer, and
there's an obscure bit of experience you can earn here if you happen to
have a Bard in your party. In which case, talk to Fleezum, ask about the
portrait he drew, and tell him he has talent. Based upon the opinion of
a single stranger mysteriously breaking into his room in the heart of
a fortified palace full of guards displaying a portrait last in the
hands of one of his boss's rebellious slaves, he'll decide to give up
his position as a well-paid goon working for a power-player in an evil
organization to doodle. Makes sense to me. Most of us, however, have the
good senes to NOT bring a Bard with us, and since this option won't come
up, we'll have no choice but to kill Flozum. To be fair, at least Flozum
will drop all his goodies for you if you convince him to go. He'll also
do so when you kill him. Either way, once he's gone, loot his belongings
to score the Girdle of Stromnos*1, a Long Sword +1, a Large Shield +1, a
Helmet, and a suit of Plate Mail. once you're done with this level, head
up the stairs at (x=2200, y=1000).

Note: If you don't kill Fleezum and Flozum, they may arrive to assist
Marketh in the next level.

***REWARD***
(For convincing Fleezum to become an artist)
EXP	60000

***ITEMS***
(x=1400, y=1200) Potion of Clarity x2, Potion of Insight
(x=1550, y=1300) Potion of Insulation

*1: One of the few Strength-boosting items in this game worth a damn,
since it'll actually raise your Strength to 19. Its life-span is short
amongst my party, however, as I'll be switching it out for Shimmering
Sashes as I complete playthroughs. In the meantime, however, combining
this girdle with the Guantlets of Elven Might is a good move in the
absence of multiple Shimmering Sashes.

***ITEM FISHING***
Not too much in the next level.. except one of the best Daggers in the
game. It's not hard to find-you'll need need to sneak over to the chest
in Marketh' room (x=1260, y=200). The item you're after? The Mage
Dagger +4, which is a great defensive weapon (oxymoron?), and gives some
bonus spells to boot. There are a few other weapons I could give my
Fighter/Mage/Thief instead, but this isn't a terrible option. I wouldn't
bother making the switch from ranged to melee until Heart of Fury mode,
however.

Old Dorn's Palace, Level 2 (AR8007)
o======================================================================o
12) THere's only one character of interest on this level-Marketh
(x=1370, y=300)-and all the loot is in Marketh's room. As much as I
hate to say it, this is justifiably a one-step area. There are plenty of
Thieves around waiting to backstab you, but they're horribly weak and
not terribly capable of hitting my party. Slaughter them to taste, but
make your way to Marketh. He'll talk to you when he spots you, and this
encounter trends towards a different outcome than we're used to. He
realizes that he's got no chance against us in a fair fight, and will
try to weasel out of one at all costs. Nearly everything you say will
end up with him trying to strike a deal with you, so as to save his own
hide. I normally prefer to indulge my lust for smiting people on these
games, but letting him go has a number of advantages. First, if you
fight him, he'll summon a Kraken Society Mage to help him-not a
terribly worrisome foe, but in Heart of Fury mode.. well, you read. Big
incentive to save yourself the headache and just avoid this fight on
Heart of Fury. Second, he'll give you all his gear if the person
speaking to him is intelligent enough to ask for it (Intelligence score
of 14 or higher required), which removes any monetary incentive to kill
him. Third, if we don't kill him here, we can complete a quest for
Ginafae for considerably more experience than Marketh or the Kraken
Society Mages will give us. The only way to really mess this up (besides
talking to Marketh with a moron) is to do so with a Paladin (same
thing?) The Paladin will not take kindly to Marketh's story of how he
came to work for Poquelin. If you do fight him, you'll find out that he
goes down without too much trouble. He will be joined by Fleezum,
Flozum, and Seth, if they are still alive. The Kraken Society Mage will
spell-buff a bit before making his way to the scene-giving you plenty of
time to fishing off Marketh and his other allies. Hit him with Dispel
Magic, Silence 15' Radius, or other debuffs like Chaos or Greater
Command before cutting him down. We all know what Fleezum, Flozum, and
Seth drop-Marketh will leave behind a 201 gold, Marketh's Badge*1, Black
Dragon Scale*2, Ring of the Gorgon*3, and the scimitar Valiant*4. The
Kraken Society Mage will drop 50 gold, a Robe of Enfusing, a Static
Dagger +1*5, and Bracers of Defense A.C. 6. The only downside to letting
Marketh go (besides the knowledge that you let him live) is the fact
that you won't get the Kraken Society Mage's gear, but it's all garbage
anyways. If you let Marketh go and demand his loot he'll give you the
Black Dragon Scale and Valiant. He'll then ask to keep his ring-he's
gaming you. It's a cursed ring (I suppose he's hoping you'll put it on
without identifying it?) that'll turn you to stone. If you make him give
up his ring, he'll also snatch 500 gold from you.

So, long story short, talk to him, let him go, but make him hand over
his gear. If you kill Marketh, Ginafae will refuse to talk to you-and
if you blame her for it, she'll commit suicide.

***HoF***
There's even more incentive to play nice with Marketh this time around.
He'll bring in four Kraken Society Mages who are fond of dropping Horrid
Wilting on the party, and all of them come to play with Stoneskin ready.
Either play nice and let Marketh go or be ready to blast the arriving
Mages with several Dispel Magics. If you do decide to fight, I suggest
running back to the stairs after talking to Marketh, where one of the
Mages will be waiting-alone. You can jump on him and quickly cut him
down, then kill Marketh. Afterwards, just wait for the other three to
show up and hit them with Dispel Magics before training your archers on
them. Hopefully you can disrupt their spells, if not, it can quickly
become a very touchy battle, as one bad Cone of Cold can wipe out
several characters. Another option is to cast Invisibility on the rest
of the party, then have them cast Antimagic Shell on themselves. Let the
Mages blow through some of their spells on the protected party Mages,
then bring forth the rest of the party, hitting the Mage with Dispel
Magic before running in. Don't be fooled into thinking that you can just
cut down the Kraken Society Mages with cheaply protected spellcasters-
they'll Tenser's after they burst through enough spells, and Antimagic
Shell will cancel out your own magical protections, including the Blur
effect of the Shimmering Sash. Another cheap, though admittedly
effective tactic is to use hit-and-run tactics from the stairs.

***REWARD***
(For retrieving Marketh's badge)
EXP	150000

***ITEMS***
(x=1570, y=420) Potion of Freedom
(x=1600, y=300) Potion of Explosions
(x=1550, y=250) Empty
(x=1250, y=240) Potion of Stone Form
(x=1260, y=200) Potion of Invulnerability,
		~Studded Leather Armor of Resistance +3*6
		(3rd Play: Short Sword of Health +4*7)
		(7th Play: Mage Dagger +4*8)
(x=1180, y=310) Potion of Mirrored Eyes, Potion of Master Thievery

*1: Another badge-keep it in your inventory.
  ---
*2: Sleek black armor with a base Armor Class of four, +25% Acid
Resistance, and +2 Save vs. Spells. Unfotunately, it's not Mage-
friendly, so I have no use for it.
  ---
*3: This cursed ring turns its wearer to stone. It's just Marketh's
parting shot for dissolving his position of power.
  ---
*4: A +2 Scimitar that gives an extra attack a round. It's a decent
weapon for a Druid.
  ---
*5: This horribly out-dated Dagger is merely a +1 weapon with a 50%
chance to deal 1d3 electrical damage.
  ---
*6 +3 Studded Leather Armor with a slew of resistances-15% Resistance
to Piercing, Slashing, Fire, Electrical and a +2 Save vs. Spells.
  ---
*7: A +4 Short Sword with a 15% chance to heal the wielder for 1d6
points.
  ---
*8: Honestly, it's not a bad Dagger at all, especially not for a
dual-or-multi-class Mage. It's a +4 Dagger that gives a bonus 1st, 2nd,
or 3rd level Mage spell, a +2 bonus to Armor Class, +3 Save vs. Spells,
and +15% Magical Resistance. Quite possibly the best Dagger in the game.

		2) Pale Justice
		3) Some Useful Spells..
		4) Eliminating Umber Hulks
		5) Simulacrum Smite
		6) Murdering Malavon

Slums (AR8009)
o======================================================================o
1) We're done with Marketh now, one way or another, and it's time to go
after Malavon. Go back to the antechamber-the room with the Shriekers-
and go through the door at (x=1000, y=500). Spell-buffing before you get
here isn't a bad idea, as you'll find this area is crawling with Blind
Minotaurs and umber Hulks, both of which are moderately mean in melee.
The latter can also cause Confusion, which makes them some of the most
threatening critters we've faced thus far. Again, I hate gloating
(I love it!), but having five Clerics-each with the ability to cast
Chaotic Commands-comes in handy, as this spell will nullify their
Confusion gazes. Disarm the trap ahead (x=2050, y=2600) and smite some
more baddies to the east (which is just a dead end).

***TRAPS***
(x=2050, y=2600)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Now head west and smite more baddies. There's an exit back to the
smelter level at (x=500, y=2800), which you should ignore. From this
exit, however, head north and disarm yet another clack-eye trap on the
ground (x=1300, y=2170). From the trap head northwest, where some
Umber Hulks will burst out of some houses and ambush you. Go into the
eastern of these two ambush-houses and search a corpse to find a normal
Long Sword.. hey wait.. that's not called 'Long Sword'! It's called Pale
Justice*1!

***ITEMS***
(x=920, y=1340) Pale Justice*1

***TRAPS***
(x=1300, y=2170)

*1: An awesome sword, and one of the.. not so few reasons why making a
Paladin in Icewind Dale isn't a bad idea (until you install Heart of
Winter and expand the level cap, making Paladins obsolete.) It's a Long
Sword +4, +7 versus evil that makes you immune to Cloak of Fear, Horror,
Dire Charm, and Symbol of Hopelessness. Of course, is this better than
the Long Sword of Action +4? Probably not, but unlike that weapon, this
one is guaranteed to drop in the main game... although again, if you
have the expansions you'll find a few Long Swords of Action +4.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Head east from the ambush houses and continue smiting our drab-
pallete foes. Ignore the stairs at (x=1900, y=1100) and continue smiting
your way east. When you reach a dead-end, turn south to find another
innocent-seeming buildings. Loot some containers (x=2270, y=1750) to the
west to score some spell scrolls, then head east and.. loot some more
containers (x=3060, y=1700) for more scrolls! It's about time we started
building our 7th-level spells up. Anyways, head back to the stairs we
ignored earlier and enter Malavon's Sanctuary.

***ITEMS***
(x=2270, y=1750) Scroll of Mordenkainen's Sword,
		 Scroll of Power Word: Stun*1
(x=3060, y=1700) Scroll of Power Word: Silence*2,
		 Scroll of Summon Monster V

*1: This will be my description for pretty much ALL Power Word spells-
it allows no save, but has a Hit Point threshold. Any creature with 91+
Hit Points is unaffected by this spell, which means against many
critters it WILL work unfailingly. On Heart of Fury mode, however,
everything will have too many Hit Points to be effected-and when they
have few enough Hit Points, they'll be quickly dead. For that reason,
I don't put too much stake into Power Word spells.
  ---
*2: And.. the exception to the Power Word spell rule. This spell just
works, and silences a foe for two rounds. Two rounds isn't a long time,
but with six Mages, we can potentially daisy-chain them to continually
nerf a spell-caster.

Malavon's Sanctuary (AR8010)
o======================================================================o
4) You'll be greeted by a pair of Umber Hulks as soon as you enter, so
be prepared for some immediate Confusion gazes. Another Umber Hulk can
be found if you explore to the west, along with plenty of Blind
Swirfneblins who have nothing of interest to say. In fact, this level
is just like the level upon which we found Marketh-lots of boring, save
for the boss. Head east from where you entered and park your party in
the next circular room over. Cast your longer-lasting buffs (Emotion
spells, Protection from Evil 10' Radius, Mirror Image, Blur, Stoneskin,
etc.) Once done, head forward with your most well-protected party
member (this is, of course, Ilnathias for me).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Malavon is at (x=1700, y=470), and when he spots you, he'll begin a
pleasant conversation. He's got a bunch of Svirfneblin slaves gathered
around and a pair of Iron Golems, and he's not afraid to let the latter
play hopscotch on the former. It should become quite apparent that
Malavon is quite nutters. If you play good, he'll demand you drop your
weapons.. after which he'll sic his Golems on you anyways. If you don't
capitulate, he'll sic his Golems on you. Bottom line? He'll sic his
Golems on you. Iron Golems use a Cloudkill effect before attacking-
which will kill most of-if not all-the Swirfneblins. Malavon is very,
very easy to defeat for one reason-his combat is incredibly scripted.
The game anticipates, almost REQUIRES, that you run into the room
Malavon is in. Of course, with Cloudkills why would any sane person
do that? When Malavon goes hostile lure the two Iron Golems and the
four Umber Hulks that attack back to the west and dismantle them there
with your party (note that the Iron Golems require +3 weapons to hit, so
have any archers shoot at the Umber Hulks, instead). Once they're dead,
I sneak with Syrenil through the Cloudkills to a safe spot and calmly
shoot Malavon down-he's full of weaksauce, an will only take a couple of
arrows (he only has 33 Hit Points-which is a joke.)

Note: When messing around with Infinity Explorer I noticed some unused
dialogue options where you can manipulate the Iron Golems to turn on
Malavon. It apparently requires the following global variable:

"Golem_Commands","GLOBAL"1

These commands were, as far as I knew, not in the game (or I had missed
them about a dozen times, which sadly, isn't beyond the realm of
possibility.) After looking it up, it seems that, indeed, these commands
were cut out of the game. But, for the sake of interest, here's how
things could have gone, if you had the commands..

Protagonist with an Intelligence score of 8 or lower:
Protagonist: "Malavon, I have just one word for you: Stam."
Malavon: "Well, thanks a lot, friend.  You just commanded my golems to
	  attack.  Thanks for saving me the effort!  Ha ha ha!  Idiot."

Protagonist with an Intelligence score of 9-15:
Protagonist: "Malavon, I have just one word for you: Met."
Malavon: "Aaaagh!  Damn you!  How did you find the command word to
	 temporarily shut down my golems?  I'll have your eyes on a
	 skewer for this!  *Die!*"

Protagonist with an Intelligence score of 16+:
Protagonist: "Malavon, I have two words for you: Kalam, Stam."
Malavon: "What?  No.  *No!*  Stay back, my pets, stay back!  Aaaagh!"

This would have made the Malavon fight more interesting, surely, but
we didn't need the Golems to pulverize a 33 Hit Point Mage. Perhaps it
was intentionally removed when the developers realized that Malavon and
his Umber Hulks were helpless against Iron Golems.. or when they
realized that verbal commands could just be repeated by Malavon? Who
knows.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Didn't think it was that easy, did you? You're right. Once Malavon
dies-Malavon will appear! Right in the midst of your party in the
circular room west of where the first Malavon started. He'll
congratulate you for knocking off his simulacrum before ranting a bit
about his awesome victory over Saablic Tan (the Umber Hulk we killed
Krilag for). After that exposition, he'll attack. Again, Malavon counts
on you having rushed into the room to the east to tackle the Iron
Golems. He's fond of casting Malavon's Corrosive Fog into that room-
which of course, does nothing (my Fighter/Mage/Thief keeps her head
down and gets clear of cloud effects). He's also fond of other area of
effect spells, like Death Fog, Cloudkill, and Web, but our fully buffed
party is just too resilient to fall for such tricks. He'll also
Dimension Door around, meaning any area's he's spell-nuked won't be the
least bit interesting for us to remain in. I suppose his tactic is
casting Web and allowing his cloud spells to damage paralyzed party
members, and if you didn't kill his Simulacrum last, there might be
Umber Hulks and Iron Giants left to complicate things?-I wouldn't know,
it never works. Once he appears, immediately send all your party members
to attack him. Cast a Haste if you don't have one already and pummel
Malavon to death. Again, he'll Dimension Door around a lot, so if you
see him vanish and sense your retarded party members might rush through
Webs and cloud spells. reign them in. You can afford to play cat-and
mouse with him. Why don't we start out with a spell-barrage against
him? You know, Silence 15' Radius, Greater Command, Chaos, and all those
wonderful debuffs? His Magic Resistance is 86% base, and he's wearing
Robes of the Watcher, which gives another +10%. He is, for all intents
and purposes, immune to magic. On the plus side, he only has 60 Hit
Points, his Armor Class is crap, and his Stoneskin won't last forever.
Attack him in the room where he appears until he flees and goes on a
tantrum-using Dimension Door to get about the level, where he'll
unleash Web/Cloudkill combos. If he shows his face again, attack him.
If left to his own devices, he may end up in his personal chambers
south of his throne room, where he'll summon a few monsters, then wait
for you. If you avoid chasing him, this fight is cheese. Let him drain
himself, attack him only when he comes to you, and after he's spent
head over in force to put him down. Note that the room where we killed
simulacrum Malavon's golems and Umber Hulks, and where we chase off
the real Malavon, is not immune to being targeted by Malavon by his
Web/cloud attack combo-but if he targets it, he'll have to show up and
make a target of himself.

***HoF***
First things first, we're smart enough NOT to run into the room with
Malavon and his Golems, right? Lure them out to you, and you can
usually destroy the golems and the Umber Hulks before even bringing
Malavon into the fight. Malavon himself isn't even spell buffed, and his
first form dies with ease. Once the real Malavon shows up, he runs
pretty much like he did in the normal game, albeit with a lot more
Hit Points. He will have a mage named Ilair show up, as well as a host
of Invisible Stalkers, which were more annoying than threatening. I
pummeled Malavon as soon as his second form showed up, and when he
Dimension Doors away, I promptly focus all of my attacks on Ilair. Once
she dies, I focus on Invisible Stalkers and wait for Malavon to show up
again. I do not allow my party to chase him through his complex. Ilair
will drop a Ring of Free Action and Robes of the Evil Archmagi. That's
pretty much the best strategy for this fight-stay in the room just
west of Malavon's throne room, do not chase him around.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) The Malavons are dead and his level is ready for some hardcore
lootin'! You get 11000 experience for killing the fake Malavon, 50000
experience for killing the real Malavon, and 337500 experience for
picking up his badge (or double that if you switch to Insane difficulty
before picking it up!) The fake Malavon drops a Robe of the Evil
Archmagi, the real Malavon drops the Robe of the Watcher*1, Malavon's
Badge*2, Fire Kiss*3, and a Scroll of Malavon's Rage*4. Be absolutely
sure to loot the room south of where Malavon's Simulacrum was, as it
contains a host of useful spells (including the game-breaking Tenser's
Transformation).

*1: Now this is better. It has a base Armor Class of three, 10% Magic
Resistance, +2 Saves vs. Spells, Non-Detection, and Immunity to Umber
Hulk Gazes. Best of all, you can wear other protection items with them
(like Rings of Protection +2.) It's my dream to put one of these on my
entire party, since it's the most protective armor (all other things
considered) that allows us to cast Mage spells. This could go on
anybody, but anticipating multiple playthroughs, I first try to discard
any heavy armor I still have. Anybody who already has Elven Chainmail
or the Shadowed Robes doesn't need to upgrade yet.
  ---
*2: Another badge. We know what to do with these by now-no, I will NOT
stop reminding you.
  ---
*3: A +3 Dagger that has a 5% chance to inflict the target with Shroud
of Flame. We've found better by now.
  ---
*4: An area of effect spell centered on the caster that damages
everything in its path-friend or foe alike. Damage spells suck in Heart
of Fury, and party-unfriendly ones suck even more.
  ---
*5: Another stat-changing potion, this one gives a +2 bonus to Wisdom
at the cost of -1 Dexterity. We do not need to lose Armor Class to gain
a few Clerical spells.
  ---
*6: A rather interesting ring, indeed, it gives the wearer 'Increased
Regeneration' at the cost of -5% Magic Resistance and -2 Saves vs.
Spells. Those are harsh penalties, but they can be overcome. First,
being a triple-classer means all our saves are pretty good by default.
A high level Mage can look forward to a base Save vs. Spells of four.
The Robe of the Watcher-which all my characters will eventually wear-
entirely negates the downsides of this ring, and in full Heart of Fury
gear, even with this ring my Save vs. Spells will be two, and our Magic
Resistance will be 45%. It's worth considering as a secondary ring. With
any spell-buffing, our saves will all be well into the negative,
anyways. Of course, you need not wear this ring all the time. Swtich
it out as necessity demands with a Ring of the Warrior or a Ring of
Fire Resistance.
  ---
*7: Another intresting ring, this device gives a bonus attack per round
at the cost of two point of Armor Class. Ultimately, I don't feel the
trade-off is worth it.
  ---
*8: This spell instantly kills a number of creatures in the area of
the spell-the weaker the critters, the more are slain. I haven't really
found this spell to be terribly effective in this game, and I rarely
bother to use it.
  ---
*9: Another instant-death spell, but this can actually work on big foes.
Be careful using it, it can destroy items in that monsters' inventory.
You probably want to avoid using it unless you KNOW the monster doesn't
have any items to pick up. Since it doesn't have a save penalty, you're
better off using other spells.
  ---
*10: The Amulet of Dark Flesh is another cursed object that will
paralyze and disease the wearer. These lieutenants seem to be of the
persuasion that if you can't beat 'em.. leave cursed items around and
hope they put it on.
  ---
*11: Finger of Death is probably my favorite spell ever. I'm not sure
why, but I sure love it in paper and pencil play. The target saves, or
it dies, simple as that. No Hit Point maximum, no destruction of
equipment, and hey, even if they succeed, they still take 3-17 damage.
(2d8+1).
  ---
*12: Like Invisibility, but in a 30-foot radius. Even if it dispels
after attacking, it's still a great first-strike spell, since unlike in
Baldur's Gate 2, critters in this game are woefully incapable of
dealing with invisibility.
  ---
*13: Tenser's Transformation is a great spell for a Mage to beef up
their combat stats.. and it's the core of my party strategy. See, the
developers apparently didn't consider that somebody might make a dual-
or-multi-classed Mage with good combat stats BEFORE using Tenser's. Stay
with me now. One of my Fighter/Mage/Clerics.. taken.. oh, almost at
random at the moment. Ilnathias has a -15 Armor Class, a THACo of four,
103 Hit Points, and he gets two attacks per round.
  ---
*14: Ginafae needs this to free herself from Malavon's spells.
  ---
*15: More stuff that'll help Valestis restore the Arboretum in the
Severed Hand.
  ---
*16: Probably the best monster summoning spell in the game.. for a Mage,
anyways. It'll be a while before I can even cast it, but ti does have
it's place in my spell books.. mostly because 9th level spells are
pretty awful in this game.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) Let's finally finish up Marketh's realm by giving Ginafae the Oil of
Null Effect we just found. I will assume you remember where she is.. and
if not, scroll up and get your remembering on. If you killed Marketh
she is inconsolable, and if he's still around (you didn't talk to him
yet) she elects to stick around and wait for him. Given the way he
talked about her.. oh well, it's her problem not ours. I find it odd
that Malavon would cast spells on his sister, but couldn't be bothered
to put in a contingency in case he died.. oh well. Give her the potion
for some quest experience.

***REWARD***
(For setting Ginafae free)
EXP	80000

Norl's Workshop (AR8015)
o======================================================================o
9) Two down, two to go. Now, to prove there was some method to this
madness. We killed Marketh first, then Malavon-the former to get an
item we need that'll invite us to complete some quests in as-of-yet
unexplored areas, and the latter to get ahold of his awesome spells
and Robe.. and also, you know, because he was kind of on the way. Leave
Marketh's Palace and return to the smelter level. Head Southwest
across the bridges leading away from Marketh's palace and go north to
find.. another bridge we haven't explored yet! Cross it and crush three
Tarnished Sentries before entering a house at (x=2330, y=600). Inside
you'll find Norl-a gem cutter in the 'employ' of Marketh. He'll tell
you about Marketh, and more importantly, Marketh's master, who is
apparently some priest of Ilmater named Poquelin. What's the point of
coming here? None, I'm just covering my bases so it doesn't look like
I'm skipping things.

Note: In the item files of the game there's a 'Copy of Marketh's Ring',
which according to the description was created by "Norl, a hobbled gem
cutter in Dorn's Deep". What this ring was supposed to do is anyone's
guess, although the ring this is a copy of is presumably his Ring of
the Gorgon. Perhaps we could have used it to trick somebody into putting
the cursed ring on? It does seem like the encounter with Marketh was a
little simple, doesn't it? Perhaps this ring is the remnant of a much
more sophisticated story that was cut, like Malavon's Golems and the
Voice of Durdel Anatha. Lots of cuts in this chapter..

The Pit (AR8003)
o======================================================================o
1) Leave Norl's Worshop, cross the bridge back to the southwest, and
head northwest. It's time to head down the elevator at (x=800, y=700).
As soon as you make it to the bottom you'll be harassed by a taciturn
Gnome named Tarnelm. Ensure him you're not there to pick on him and
he'll he'll tell you about some Salamanders, a priest named Beorn, and
tell you to go make yourself useful by getting him and his buddies some
food. He'll suggest you look in Marketh's Palace or in Malavon's
Sanctuary. Tell him Malavon is a deader, and he'll offer to show you
the secret hideout of the Swirfneblin here-again, if you get some food
for them. Talk to him again and give him the potatoes we found in
Marketh's Palace for an experience reward. See? That's why we did that
first.

***REWARD***
(For giving Tarnhelm the potatoes)
EXP	80000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Once he's fed, he immediately shows his insolence by asking for more
help! Lazy welfare-addict socialist scum! Apparently some Umber Hulks
of Malavon's are looking for the Swirfneblin encampment, and they'll
find it sooner or later. Tarnelm wants you to head to the northeastern
tunnels, where your presence will provoke the Umber Hulks. Once you've
smote them, you can follow some red lights in the tunnels to the
Swirfneblin Camp. If you find his story about the Umber Hulks not being
able to detect red light very well to be a bit far fetched, then you're
probably an under-educated boob who thinks the world is less than
10,000 years old. It's not. Some bioluminescent deep-water fish emit
red light-which naturally does not occur at such depths. Hence, many
organisms dwelling at such depths cannot see red light, nor the creature
emiting said light. The predators, on the other hand, are not so
handicapped, and this allows the predator to see the prey (especially
if the prey, too, is red, like some shrimp) without alerting the prey to
its presence. I'm not sure that such a phenomenon would occur naturally
underground-cave dwelling creatures tend to lose their eyesight
altogether, since stone and earth simply shut out light, whereas water
absorbs it in gradiations that vary by depth. More plausibly Umber Hulks
should be blind, and use echolocation, vibration detection, or smell to
find prey. I'm not going into wavelights and all that, do some reading
yourselves. You can also ask Tarnelm about Maiden Ilmadia, which will
let you bluff a Fire Giant later. Anyways, it's time to be beetle bait!
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Head south and you'll encounter a Rhinoceros Beetle-now that's one
huge freakin' bug! It's all looks, though. Smash it and pick up its
Rhino Beetle Shell. Unlike all the Umber Hulk Hide we've been ignoring,
this is actually useful. Continue east and smite another Rhinoceros
Beetle and some Umber Hulks. Go north and kill a third Rhinoceros Beetle
before turning east again. This terrain is awfully sucky, and it's hard
to see what's going on, but make your way to roughly (x=2000, y=800)
and wait. While you wait, consider spell-buffing, as a fair-sized horde
of Hulks will pop out of the walls to the north. Put them down, then
exit through any one of the tunnels.. why not.. oh.. (x=2200, y=700)?

Lower Dorn's Deep, Svirfneblin Sanctuary (AR8004)
o======================================================================o
4) When you enter this area, a Svirfneblin named Beorn will talk to
you. Throw Tarnelm's name out and insist that you're not here to hurt
anybody (although if I have to keep saying that..) He'll ask you to
meet him in the temple later so you can discuss 'something of grave
importance'. Let me guess.. they've finally decided to stop being
useless and are going to stand up for themselves, right? If only..
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) The Drow merchant, Nym, is at (x=380, y=1240), and although he's of
a vile race of ebon-skinned xenophobes.. he sells good stuff! Ah damn,
being raised in a capitalistic society has clearly eroded my values..
Anyways, if you want to chat with him, he'll admit he stole and sold the
artifacts made by the Elves of the Hand of the Seldarine and the Dwarves
of Dorn's deep to the Goblins. You can get angry at him, but it's a
better idea to shop first, as he sells all kinds of goodies. Buy all
the scrolls, Mystery of the Dead, 'A Cage of Exotic Birds*1' and 'A Cage
of Squirrels*1'.

Mystery of the Dead
One of the better shields in the game, it gives a +3 bonus to Armor
Class a +1 bonus vs. Missile Weapons, and the bearer is immune to Finger
of Death and Power Word: Kill. Few characters will ever cast those
spells, so I wouldn't worry about it. I buy this shield and give it to
Kaelinalia, who hands her Large Shield +1, +4 vs. Missile Weapons to
Nauzhir the Red.
  ---
Staff of Moradin's Breath
This is a +2 Quarter Staff that can be used to cast Resurrect. I don't
let my characters die, and +2 is quite out-dated by now.
  ---
Viol of the Hollow Men
Another Bardic device, this one summons 1d4 Shadows once per day. And
this item has an absurdly long description.

*1: Both of these items can be given to Valestis in the Severed Hand.
We finally have all the items required to restore the Arboretum.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) At (x=1630, y=1330) you'll find Dirty/Dainty Llew. Talk to him with
the prettiest, femaleist creature in your party, as he.. well, he likes
the boobies and we'll get a discount for it. A discount on what, you
ask? Ask him if he can make something out of those Rhinoceros Beetle
Shells we found earlier. If you talk to him with a female protagonist
with a Charisma of 16 or higher it'll cost 5000 gold. If you talk to him
with a female protagonist with a Charisma of 15 or lower it'll cost 9000
gold. Finally, if you talk to him with a male protagonist (no matter how
effeminate, charismatic, or Elven) it'll cost 10000 gold. Either way,
it takes three days. You can also buy potions from him. If you want to
quickly pass the time, you can rest in the house at (x=950, y=900).
Come back after enough time has passed and he'll give you the rather
unimpressive Rhino Beetle Shield*1. Sucks? You're right. But we can
fix it.

Umber Hulk Plate
Simple armor, it has a base Armor Class of two and gives a +1 bonus
vs. Slashing Weapons. By now we found plenty of armor that's better
than this.

*1: +1 Armor Class and a +1 bonus vs. Missile Weapons. It's not a
very impressive shield at this point.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Talk to Nym and ask if he can enchant your shield-and good news,
he can! For the low, low price of 30,000 gold. If you complain about
the price he'll offer to throw in an enchanted dagger*1 for 33,000 gold
total (the dagger isn't worth it). If you tell him to keep the Dagger,
he'll lower his price for just the shield to 28,000 gold. Accept, and
in another three days you'll have your newly enchanted shield*2.

Note: There's also an item called 'Orrick's Rhino Beetle Shield' still
in the game's files. Presumably it was planned to allow you to choose
to get the Rhino Beetle Shield enchanted by either Nym or Orrick, but
no such dialogue remains for Orrick, making this 'quest' somewhat more
cut than usual. Orrick's Rhino Beetle Shield would have had an Armor
Class of four and would have given a +1 bonus versus Missile Weapons.

*1: Nym's Dagger is a +2 Dagger with absolutely nothing intesting
about it. Paying an extra 3,000 gold for this item is a waste.
  ---
*2: A shield with +3 Armor Class, +1 versus missiles, and 15% Fire
Resistance. Eraithul equips this, and discards his Large Shield +1, +4
vs. Missiles.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) When you're done buying, selling, sleeping, and whatnot, head to
(x=1430, y=500) to talk to Beorn. He'll ask you to save their priest
Guello, and protect them from some Umber Hulks. Agree to do it, then
leave this camp and ascend the elevator. Once back in the smelter level
head over to the southeastern corner of the map and exit at
(x=3400, y=2400).

Mines (AR8008)
o======================================================================o
9) When you arrive you'll be harrassed by some Salamanders. Smite them
and continue east until you find Guello-who will talk at you. He'll
be a brainiac and inform you that the Salamanders here are hostile.
Good tip! Tell him about Beorn's mission and note-Beorn said that Guello
was captured by Seth, while Guello says he was captured by some of
Malavon's Umber Hulks. Oh well, let's not pay too much attention to it.
He'll insist you slay Shikata-the Salamander king before he can leave.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Fair enough, our goal now is to clear the level of Salamanders. Do
so. Back track to the west and head east along an elevated ledge along
the southern-most edge of the level. When you reach an area exit at
(x=2400, y=1050) turn north, then follow the tracks back west, smiting
Salamanders as you go. Shikata is at (x=1220, y=600), and when he spots
you he'll have some token, pointless dialogue. Provoke him and let him
come to you. Buffing will help, but he's not all that tough. Kerish
will drop the spear Slayer*1 when he falls.

***HoF***
I didn't find this area particularly challenging-Symbols of Hopelessness
immobilized plenty of the Salamanders, after which I took them out as
I pleased.

*1: Our first +5 weapon.. at least if you're been following my guide.
There's nothing terribly exceptional about it otherwise.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Talk to Guello and tell him the good news, and he'll return to the
Swirfneblin camp at the next convenient opportunity. Return there as
well and talk to Guello to score an experience reward. Now, we're almost
done here, believe it or not. This is a good time to head back to
Kuldahar and sell off any and all loot rotting in your inventory, buy
any spells and potions you might need, and turn in the crap you've
collected for Valestis' Arboretum. We'll soon be deprived of the
freedom to roam about as we please.

***ITEM FISHING***
There are a number of items that can be fished for in the next area
(AR8011), including one of the best swords in the game (x=1800, y=2100)
and the best Cross Bow in the game (x=1880, y=2100).

Fire Lake (AR8011)
o======================================================================o
1) It's finally time to go find this Maiden Ilmadia. I have a good
feeling about her, I mean, virgins are always honorable and pure, right?
Return to Lower Dorn's Deep and head back to where you killed Shikata
and go through the exit at (x=2020, y=900). Spell-buff before you enter,
as a fight awaits us. When you enter, a Salamander will warn you against
trying to close some portals that are letting elemental critters in.
Anything you say provokes it, and just as well. Kill Salamanders and
elementals as you head east, then south, then back west. Ignore the
passage at (x=2000, y=600).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) A Fire Giant (x=1400, y=800) will come to chat with you. If you ask
about Maiden Ilmadia (possible if you asked Tarnelm about her earlier)
or say you're lost you'll avoid a fight.. but there's no real reason
to avoid one. We can bypass all the Fire Giants on the way to Maiden
Ilmadia, but we're in a better position to kill them here. I spell-buff
to the max and take the Fire Giants on-Prayer, Draw Upon Holy Might,
Recitation, Righteous Wrath of the Faithful, Emotion: Courage, Emotion:
Hope, Protection from Evil 10' Radius, Defensive Harmony, and Haste-all
of which can be popped out in three rounds. This decreases the Armor
Class and THAC0 of my entire party by seven-translation: turns them all
into unstoppable phenoms. If you do want to talk to Maiden Ilmadia,
however, head on down there after talking to the Fire Giant.

Note: Make sure you cast Haste BEFORE casting Righteous Wrath of the
Faithful. Haste will not stack with Righteous Wrath of the Faithful,
but Righteous Wrath of the Faithful will stack with Haste.. it doesn't
make a whole lot of sense, but it works.

Note from Lee:
Keep the party east of the bridges, somewhere around (x=2400, y=1250),
and let the Fire Giants come to you. They can only cross the bridges
one at a time, making them easier to deal with. Even so, this is an
ugly fight... Plus, everything and everyone in both this and the next
step will eventually make it's way up to you, including Bitch Ilmadia.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) You'll find Maiden Ilmadia in the southeast portion of the map, at
(x=1880, y=2150). You can chit-chat with her for a bit, and listen to
her schemes, but ultimately a fight ensues. If you can take down Fire
Giants, you can kill Maiden Ilmadia (which is good, because if you're
fighting one, you'll shortly be fighting the other!), and there's really
no strategy involved. Everything here is melee-oriented and living,
making them vulnerable to a whole slew of spells (or my mighty spell-
buffing tactic, above.) When Maiden Ilmadia falls, she'll leave behind
85 gold, an Oil of Speed, Maiden Ilmadia's Badge*1, Black Swan Armor*2,
Alamion*3, and The Argent Shield*4.

***HoF***
let's be honest here. Fire Giants do wretched damage, sometimes in the
range of 90 points per hit. Fully spell-buffing is mandatory.. or at
least Stoneskin, Haste, and Mirror Image, to give your front-liners some
staying power. I avoid Tensers for this fight, as it's likely I will
need to withdraw wounded characters and cast Heal and Stoneskin. Maiden
Ilmadia is no less lethal, and this time she comes with a pair of Priest
-Mages of Vhaeraun. These two typically fight very well-for Clerics-and
they come into the fight spell-buffed with Stoneskin. Fortunately they
won't show up until after most of the fighting is done. They'll probably
be the last two you kill, and if you're expedient you can be ready for
them. I pick a fight as soon as I enter the level and hold my ground. As
the enemies  come from the south hit them with periodic Symbols of
Hopelessness. This does take away from my front-line presence, but it's
a necessary evil in this case. Hopefully some of the Fire Giants will be
immobilized and gum up the works, allowing you to deal with the front-
runners, while blasting any newcomers with more Symbols of Hopelessness.
For this fight I even cast Summon Monster VII near the area where I
focus my Symbols of Hopelessness (typically behind the Fire Giants I am
actively engaging). This will draw some fire from me, slow down new
enemies, and allow my monsters to attack helpless enemies. For what it's
worth, the Priest-Mages of Vhaeraun drop Mage Robes of Cold Resistance
and Sanctified Morning Stars +3.

		 (7th Play: Doom Halberd +3*10)
(x=1880, y=2100) ~Repeating Heavy Cross Bow*11
		 (6th Play: Reinforced Heavy Crossbow*12)
		 (7th Play: Repeating Light Crossbow*13)
(x=1970, y=2080) Elixer of Health x2, Potion of Magic Shielding

*1: Another badge. Again, hold onto it. This makes five out of six.
  ---
*2: I don't know why, but I just love this armor. It's got a base
Armor Class of one, gives a +1 bonus to Charisma, and gives +10%
Resistance to Fire, Cold, Electrical, and Acid damage. Unfortunately,
it's not Mage-friendly and you can't use protection gear with it, so it
doesn't make it on anybody.
  ---
*3: She really didn't like Salamanders, for how much she otherwise
seemed fine of fiery critters. This is a +3 Long Sword that acts as a
+5 weapon vs. Salamanders, gives +10% Fire Resistance, and a -5% penalty
to Cold Resistance.
  ---
*4: This is the best shield in the game, granting a +3 bonus to Armor
Class and +25% Magic Resistance. Unfortunately, you need to be an Elf or
Half-Elf to use it.. hey! My whole party is comprised of Half-Elves!
Score. I give it to Ilnathias and pass down all the sheilds,
accordingly. Now everybody has a +3 Armor Class Shield (or better),
and all my Large Shields +1, +4 vs. Missile are now gone.
  ---
*5: Well, there also has to be one shitty weapon in the bunch, and
this has to be the worst of the lot. It's a mere +2 weapon that has a
15% chance to phase targets and a 25% chance to deal +1d4 cold damage.
  ---
*6: A +4 Bastard Sword that has a 15% chance to infect the target with
disease. It cannot be wielded by good-aligned characters. Eat me.
  ---
*7: A +3 Bastard Sword that gives a two-point bonus to Armor Class a
+10% resistance bonus to Crushing, Slashing, Piercing, and Missile
attacks, and a +1 bonus on Saving Throws. One of the best one-handed
swords in the game.
  ---
*8: One of the better Halberds in the main game, it's a +3 weapon that
adds one point to Dexterity and gives a 5% resistance bonus to Slashing
and Piercing. Also it has a 15% chance to stun targets. Not bad.
  ---
*9: A +4 Two Handed Sword that deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage.
Unfortunately it has a 25% chance to hit the wielder for 1d4 piercing
damage, making it more of a pain in the ass than anything else. Perhaps
even literally!
  ---
*10: A +3 Halberd that has a 50% chance to deal +2d3 fire damage and a
15% chance to stun. All in all, I'd take this Halberd over the Star-
Forged Halberd +3.
  ---
*11: +5 THAC0 and damage, three attacks per round. This is the best
Cross Bow you can find.
  ---
*12: +7 Damage and +4 THAC0, but it only has two attacks per round.
It's not as good as the Repeating Heavy Crossbow, but it's still an
improvement over the Heavy Crossbow of Accuracy.
  ---
*13: This crossbow deals +3 damage and +5 THAC0, and has three attacks
per round. All things considered, why wouldn't you grab the Repeating
Heavy Crossbow instead?

Temple of Ilmater (AR8012)
o======================================================================o
4) Only one place left to explore. We could have come here earlier, but
there was no real need to until now. Head to the northern part of the
level and exit at (x=2000, y=600). Once you enter this area you'll be
beset by a horde of Boneguard Skeletons-so be prepared for a scuffle.
They're melee critters we've met before, but not in these numbers. Best
option? Long-lasting defensive buffs and elbow grease. Once they're
dead you'll find Brother Adson (x=940, y=1440) to the west, who only
speaks gibberish. Here's how this level works-in the northwestern
corner of the area you'll find The Idol (x=920, y=580), destroying it
will destroy all the undead on the level and free all the captive
priests. However, it's a bit of a task to rush it with a low-level
party, and there's good experience that can be farmed if we exterminate
all the undead, but this requires some caution, as we shall see.

***HoF***
There are just too many enemies here to bother contending with them all.
The Boneguard Skeletons may not be the direst of threats, but their
Hit Points will keep them in your way. This allows the Greater Mummies
to really tear you apart with their spells, and a character struck by
Symbol of Hopelessness can be quickly torn to shreds by the Boneguard
Skeletons. There are two solutions I have used to get through this area
in Heart of Fury mode: 1) Before entering this area Haste, and protect
your party members with Stoneskin and Greater Invisibility. Then rush
into the level, past all the enemies, and directly attack the Idol. Once
the Idol is destroyed, so are all the undead. 2) Invisosmite! Yeah, I
know, Invisosmite has really lowered the bar when it comes to strategy,
and made this guide so much cheaper.. but dammit, it works!
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Now head north to find Brother Perdiem (x=1060, y=1000), who will
iniate dialogue with you. You'll get some extra lines if your speaking
protagonist is a Cleric or a Paladin where you can dispute the teachings
of Ilmater, but it doesn't make a bit of difference. He ends up
threatening you. Ignore him and note the Greater Mummies nearby. They
can be a pain, as they'll cast Symbol of Hopelessness (the best Clerical
debuff in the game) Symbol of Pain, and Flame Strike. I hit them with
two Silence 15' Radii (hopefully if one misses, the other will work). If
they're both silenced, they'll have no choice but to engage in melee.
I kill them AWAY from Brother Perdium, then proceed to smite the undead
to the east. The idea? kill the undead throughout the rest of the
level before we tackle the area north of Brother Perdium. Thinning the
herd and all that.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) When you approach Brother Harken (x=1660, y=700) he'll babble
nonsense at you. Kill whatever Boneguard Skeletons are near him (and the
ones that will come from the west). Once they're dead head west with a
good dose of caution and try to hit the three Greater Mummies with
Silence 15' Radius and lure them to the east, where they can be smote.
Once they're dead, you've killed five of the six Greater Mummies in this
level-together comprising the greatest threat we've seen all game.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Now return back to where Brother Perdium was and head west, where
you'll find more Boneguard Skeletons around Sister Incylia
(x=450 y=1010). She also speaks silliness, so ignore her. The last
Greater Mummy is to the northeast, and it can be easily silenced and
smote without drawing the attention of The Idol. If you would have
charged them, you'd have been facing the six of them all at once-they
come spread in two groups-the two near Brother Perdium in the south and
four more spread out south of the The Idol, north of the other two.
Letting a half-dozen Greater Mummies pelt you with Flame Strikes and
Symbol spells is a good way to get killed-so we practiced a bit of
caution. Anywho, it's time to smash The Idol (x=920, y=580). It'll cast
a number of assy spells, including Finger of Death, Sol's Searing Orb,
Flesh to Stone, and Power Word: Kill. Pair that with the Greater Mummies
and we'd have had a real problem. The herd has been sufficiently
thinned, however, so rush the Idol and smash it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) Once the Idol is destroyed, you can talk to all the freed priests
here, although most of them aren't any more interesting now than they
were before. Talk to Brother Perdium, however, and he'll tell you about
how he came to be here, and more importantly, about Poquelin. He'll
also heal you, and unlike every other Cleric we've saved, he'll do it
for free! Get yourself healed up, rest, and enjoy your quest experience.
When you're done, head northwest to find the various locks that require
those badges you've been collecting to open. You SHOULD have all six of
them. I have been reminding you at every turn about them. Anyways, it's
on you now if you've lost one. I wash my hands of it. Be sure you're
rested, your inventory is cleared, you've purchased everything you care
to purchase, and you've completed every quest you care to complete.
Place all the badges in the locks, as follows, from west to east:

	o===============o===============================o
	|(x=750, y=450) |        Marketh's Badge	|
	|---------------|-------------------------------|
	|(x=780, y=450) |        Malavon's Badge	|
	|---------------|-------------------------------|
	|(x=830, y=450) |    Maiden Ilmadia's Badge	|
	|---------------|-------------------------------|
	|(x=800, y=450) |        Krilag's Badge		|
	|---------------|-------------------------------|
	|(x=850, y=450) |	  Joril's Badge		|
	|---------------|-------------------------------|
	|(x=870, y=430)	|    Brother Perdiem's Badge	|
	o===============o===============================o

***REWARD***
(For retrieving Brother Perdiem's badge)
EXP	150000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) When you're ready, ascend the stairs at (x=900, y=300). If you go up
those stairs, you wont be returning to Kuldahar this game. Make your
final preparations before you go. Upstairs is Poquelin. In typical
villianous fashion, he'll reveal all his plans before attacking. This
silly exhibition is just the developers giggling about tying everything
together, as if their story had been complicated enough to warrant a
full disclosure. For my tastes, I find it rather silly and self-
indulgent. Why would Poquelin even mention a bit player like Accalia,
anyways? Somebody was really proud of this story.. or they wanted to
make Poquelin look like a super tool (they succeeded). Anyways, once
Poquelin is done recapping the entire story unnecessarily, he'll attack.
A number of monsters will continue to spawn to defend him (pretty much
everything you've fought in Lower Dorns Deep), while he casts spells.
Fortunately, he's not all that aggressive. Keep on Poquelin, and this
fight will be quick. Frankly, he simply cannot withstand a spell-buffed
party-he lasted all of about three seconds against my party when I
rushed him, fully-buffed. Seriously, the battle transcript is below:

So... against such puny opposition, how can I even suggest a
sophisticated strategy? I can't. It's a buff-and-rush affair. When the
fight is over (don't blink!), so is chapter 6.

***HoF***
I spell-buff to the max and treat Poquelin just like The Idol on the
level before. I turn the party AI off and rush him. He goes down
disappointingly quickly.

Note from Lee:
Well, that was disappointing... I was really expecting to have to put
up with more of a fight. What a pussy...

o======================================================================o
|								       |
|			The Power of Crenshinibon		       |
|								       |
o======================================================================o
We've chased down these mysterious lieutenants that were inhabiting
Dorn's Deep and found nothing short of an evil empire thriving in the
ruins of Lower Dorn's Deep! Our previous failures and half-measures have
been overturned by our competence in our last several battles-taking
down several potent foes instrumental to this evil operation. Finally,
we challenged the ring-leader, a phony priest called Poquelin-who was,
in fact, a demonic rival of Yxunomei's. Although we defeated him in
Dorn's Deep, it seems that he's been massing his forces around
Easthaven, of all places, the forces we crushed in Lower Dorn's Deep
were just reserves (or rather, according to Maiden Ilmadia, rearguards
that were supposed to prevent any attacks from Dark Elves. He's got one
last trick up his sleeve-the artifact Crenshinibon. If his boasts are to
be believed, this artifact is a weapon of greater potency than the
entire operation we dismantled in Lower Dorn's Deep. R.A. Salvatore
readers can giggle with nerdiness, but for me, it's just another eye
roll.

Easthaven (AR1100)
o======================================================================o
Sequence of Events:						{WLK023}
		1) Return to Easthaven
		2) The Restored Blade of Aihonen
		3) Old Jed's Hideout
		4) Saving the Citizens of Easthaven
		5) Reuniting with Everard
		6) Spritual Men, Always Concerned With the Material..
		7) Final Rest
		8) Pummeling Pompous Pomab
		9) Battle Against Belhifet

1) After the chapter ends, you'll appear in Easthaven. If you're not too
beat up, make use of the remaining spell buffs you have by exploring
the town. The enemies you'll face in this area? Cyclops. They're big,
but they're actually considerably weaker than the Fire Giants we killed
earlier, so they should pose no trouble.

***HoF***
I was still spell-buffed after my disturbingly short battle with
Poquelin, and it was a minor thing to run about slaying Cyclops.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) First thing to do is head south along the road-you'll notice most
buildings are destroyed, which simplifies things for us. I think
Easthaven looks better this way. Near the shore at (x=330, y=2530)
you'll find Jhonen. He'll tell you about what happened, and suggest you
find Everard, who might know a way into the crystal tower. If you gave
him the sword back at the beginning of the game, you'll also get a
special present. Remember when I told you to do the right thing for
Jhonen? Yeah, this is why.

***REWARD***
(For recieving the Restored Blade of Aihonen from Jhonen)
EXP	280000
ITEM	Restored Blade of Aihonen*1

*1: This +1 Long Sword is +5 within 'a dragon's flight of Lac
Dinneshere'. So, while in chapter 6, you've got a +5 Long Sword that
give you +5 Hit Points and 25% fire and cold resistance. This is an
ideal weapon for Syrenil, especially on the first playthrough. Also, on
subsequent plays, the sword remains +5 throughout the game. Hey, a
dragon's flight is apparently a good distance!

Winter's Cradle Tavern (AR1106)
o======================================================================o
3) Head back north and when the trail turns east, follow it. Kill more
Cyclops along the way until you reach the Winter's Cradle Tavern, where
you'll find a Cyclops threatening somebody through the door. Kill it,
and investigate (x=2920, y=400). Once inside, head downstairs
(x=700, y=270) to find Old Jed, who-unlike those mindless sober people-
had the sense to hide himself in the cellar of the tavern. He'll babble
a bit about the giants and captive villagers before passing out. On the
plus side, you can rest here, so if you.. heh.. were beat up while
fighting Poquelin.. maybe you fell asleep at the keyboard?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Leave the tavern and continue following the trail south, smite some
Cyclops, and cross a bridge to find the townsfolk. If you talk to any
of the 'named' townsfolk, like Grisella, they'll tell you to talk to
Everard, who seems to be the only competent one left. Talk to any other
anonymous 'Townsperson' and pick dialogue option #1 repeatedly and
they'll tell you more about what happened. The crystal tower appeared
out of nowhere, Cyclops came and smashed everything up, Everard's been
tortured (perhaps there's something in the temple they want?), and
Jhonen, Old Jed, and Pomab are missing. Well.. we've already accounted
for two of the three.. As a parting gift, you'll be given some potions
for rescuing them. Score.

***REWARD***
(For rescuing the Easthaven villagers)
Items	Elixer of Health x3
	Potion of Regeneration
	Potion of Storm Giant Strength
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Now talk to Everard, who will refuse to help the villagers. Instead,
he insists that he must help you get into the tower. Apparently our old
friend is trying to break the glyphs on Jerrod's Stone. You do remember
that the thing isn't just a grisly ornament, the kind of death-
glorifying fetishes commonly found festering in religious institutions-
it's a sealed portal to the hells, right? Apparently Poquelin's 'army'
here is as of now immaterial, he'll need to open that portal to bring
his schemes to fruition. Everard is a little over dramatic about it
"All Faerun will be destroyed..." Sure, because if we fail here, one
demon is going to open a portal and destroy the world. Khelben, Simbul,
Elminster-they're all chumps without us. Give me a break. Anyhow,
Everard will tell you how to get into the crystal tower-the equivilent
of 'abra cadabra'-and you'll get another massive experience reward.

***REWARD***
(For learning how to enter Cryshal-Tirith)
EXP	280000

Cryshal-Tirith, Level 1 (AR1101)
o======================================================================o
6) Cleverly (and obviously) enough, Poquelin build his tower right on
top of the Temple of Tempus. If only he had been smart enough to make
it inaccessible.. anyways, enter the tower at (x=700, y=600). After you
enter, Everard will come in and try to force the wards leading to
Jerrod's Stone, leaving you to search for an alternate route. Note that
Everard can heal you.. but he wont do it for free. I guess some things
are more important than saving the world. Pssh. Religious people. The
stairs up are at (x=500, y=400).

Cryshal-Tirith, Level 2 (AR1102)
o======================================================================o
7) The final resting room of the game.. and nothing else special about
it. Make sure you have all your spell-buffs prepared now, distribute
potions, and all that fun stuff. When you're ready to move on, the exit
is at (x=100, y=800).

Cryshal-Tirith, Level 3 (AR1103)
o======================================================================o
8) Here you'll find Pomab, who is apparently in league with Poquelin.
He'll spout off with villianous cliches like Poquelin did-it must be a
requirement in this game, but combat is inevitable. This is a rather
unconventional fight, as Pomab will split into many duplicates, and
you'll have to deal with Crystal Sentries. Pomab will shoot Lighting
Bolts at you, and the Crystal Sentries reanimate if you kill them.
Haste your party, and send them after Pomab. If only there was a way
to find out which one was the REAL Pomab.. oh wait, there is! If you
attack the wrong one, in the display window it'll say 'False Pomab'.
If it's the right one, it'll just say Pomab, as follows:

Eraithul- Attacks False Pomab
Eraithul- Attacks Pomab

Simple as pie-turn off party AI, target the right one, and hack him
down. He'll leave behind 58 gold and a Wand of Lightning Bolt. Rest on
the level below if you need to, the ladder up is at (x=670, y=300).

***HoF***
Really, I didn't find this fight any more challenging than before. A
Hasted, well-buffed party just stormed in and eventually cut down the
right Pomab.

Cryshal-Tirith, Level 4/Jerrod's Stone Chamber (AR1104)/(AR1105)
o======================================================================o
9) In this room is the crystal shard (Crenshinibon) and a mirror you can
go through (x=200, y=230). Don't bother spell-buffing, as you'll be
dispelled before the final fight begins. Make sure you are fully rested,
you have whatever potions you might need in quick item slots, and in
general, that you are ready to go. Everybody must have a +3 weapon or
better in order to play. Once you're commited, you'll appear in front of
Poquelin again, who gleefully opens Jerrod's Stone. You know.. he just
doesn't sound that imposing. I think it's his lisp. Anyways, Everard
will interrupt the little ceremony, announce that he was mentally
molested by Tempus, and re-enact Jerrod's sacrifice. Yay, he had a
crystalizing moment, and our story comes full circle. With the portal
now closed again, it's up to us to stop Poquelin and make good on
Everard's sacrifice. Not because we like Everard, mind you. We don't.
But because... um... [Insert motivational speech here].

Poquelin is understandably annoyed, and will take his true form-as the
demon Belhifet. He'll start out with a Dispel Magic, just to ensure
you weren't cheating, and summon two Iron Golems to help him out. This
is yet another instance where my plethora of spell-casters comes in
handy-in one round I buff with the following spells-Prayer, Recitation,
Protection from Evil 10' Radius, Righteous Wrath of the Faithful,
Emotion: Hope, and Haste. Afterwards, Belhifet will cast a Symbol of
Pain on my party and attack. I let him come to me, as much as possible,
as undetecable 'Dispel Magic' traps lie around the room. I just have
everybody melee-even Syrenil attacks with the Restored Blade of Aihonen-
her arrows will not meaningfully contribute to this fight. If you're
lucky, Belhifet will go down quickly and painlessly. Some things to
keep in mind-Belhifet has 350 Hit Points, a -12 Armor Class, 50%
magic resistance, immunity to fire, and can only be hurt by +3 or
better weapons. You're better off using buffs than magical attacks or
debuffs. The only reason this fight can be even the least bit
challenging is the fact that I didn't grind with this party, and hence,
don't have Tenser's Transformation yet, and only one of my front-
liners can cast Stoneskin.

Once Belhifet falls, the main game is over. Start a new Heart of Winter
game and import your old party. My final stats for this playthrough are
listed below, and after that, the walkthrough for Heart of Winter.

Note: During my third playthrough with my old party, I decided to test
my suspicion that my Fighter/Mage, fully spell buffed, could take on
Belhifet-alone. Alas, normal mode simply isn't any challenge, as
Belhifet falls without so much as scratching my Fighter/Mage. Heart of
Fury mode is a different story, however.

***HoF***
No such cheap victory will be forthcoming this time around. Belhifet
comes to play with two Cornuguns as well as his normal two Iron Golems.
None of the four are much of a threat compared to Belhifet, however, as
he will tear down your spell buffs with his attacks, and no single
character will last long against him. Our goal is to get as many buffs
up as possible, while staying alive. The way to do this is somewhat
simple-have one character cast Greater Shield of Lathander and attack-
hopefully drawing all the attention. Meanwhile, in the precious little
time we have, buff with Prayer, Recitation, Protection from Evil 10'
Radius, Haste, and Righteous Wrath of the Faithful, all of which can be
done in one round. If you're feeling frisky, try to get off a quick
Stoneskin, then attack with your main party, taking the attention-
grabber back and buffing a little (at least Stoneskin, although if you
had good aim, most of the previous buffs might be working on them, too.)
Attack the Iron Golems first-don't even bother with missile weapons, as
only the Coruguns will be injured by anything less than a +3 weapon.
Once Belhifet starts picking on a character, quickly remove them from
combat. Belhifet will give chase, and the rest of your party may merrily
continue to kill their target. Turn off party AI and focus on one enemy
at a time. Once the Iron Golems fall, focus on the Cornuguns until only
Belhifet is left. Draw away wounded party members, have them Heal
themselves, and return them to the fight once successful. Keep casting
Hastes with your Fighter/Mage/Thief as they fall away-she really has
nothing better to do. Once all of his minions were gone, Belhifet died
very quickly, indeed. Again, you'll want to avoid Tensers for this
fight, as the need to heal and rebuff takes precedence over the combat
boosts given by Tensers. You can always provoke a second round of
buffing by applying another Greater Shield of Lathander, but it's not
always easy to get your foes to focus on the protected character once
the fighting has begun.

Lonelywood, Exterior (AR9100)
o======================================================================o
1) You'll appear in the town of Lonelywood, and have to suffer through a
conversation with the barbarian Hjollder. You might remember his bit-
role in Kuldahar. He'll tell you that Jerrod has returned.. or rather,
he's inhabiting the body of Wylfdene, who was-and is again-a tribal
king. This revenant is apparently inciting a war between the barbarians
and Ten-Towns, but Hjollder, being the priestly sort that he is, has
found no justification from Tempus. And without some violent space ghost
telling you to kill people, war is just honorless butchery with no
higher purpose. Point of the conversation: you need to travel to
Hengorot in an attempt to stop the impending war. What, do you think,
are the odds that you'll be able to do this without crawling through
dungeons and engaging in some honorless butchery of your own? None, I
think.

Note: Once you begin Heart of Winter, you'll notice that most of your
gold is gone. I ended the main game with 327,743 gold, and started the
expansion with 15,979 gold. Don't worry, we'll earn more.

Note from Lee:
You also lose any Bags of Holding, Potion Cases, and Spell Cases you
had, including all the items that may have been therein contained.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) The first steps in this expansion should be pretty obvious-brand new
town around us, we might as well explore it, right? Head east into a
small corral to find find Rawleigh Gallaway, who will bitch about being
stuck due to the barbarian threat. Chat him up and he'll tell you where
the barbarians are, updating your world map.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Head north to find Hailee Dunn (x=1770, y=2200), who complains that
her brother fell down the well. She's too afraid to be lowered down to
get him, so you'll have to get some rope from her dad. Eh.. Don't worry,
there's no rush.

Note: If you're evil-aligned, you can show some tough love and refuse
to play along with Hailee's little game (pick any dialogue option, then
#3 and #3).

Emmerich Hawk's House (AR9104)
o======================================================================o
4) From the well, head to the east to find Emmerich Hawk's house
(x=3000, y=2250). Inside, you can talk to Mr. Hawk, who will tell you
where the barbarians are, relate a story about his falling out of favor
with the 'Forest Father', Silvanus, due to his inability to stop three
brothers who are over-hunting, his encounter with a rather unfriendly
sounding wolf, and he'll sell you bows and ammunition.. although nothing
better than what you should already have. The most interesting thing
about Emmerich, however, is that he has some very interesting gear on
his person-none of which you can steal. If you try to attack him,
however, he'll hide in shadows and vanish-so you need to kill him
quickly (Haste works wonders). If you kill him, he'll drop a Finest
Longsword, Confusion Arrows x20, Arrows of Piercing x20, Inferno
Arrows x20, a Shadowed Cloak, Bracers of Archery, a Long Bow +4: Hammer,
and 100 gold. This is, however, an inopportune time to kill him (unless
you just started the expansion to get these items). These characters
have quests for us to do, and all that. Don't worry, I'll remind you
before the expansion is over to come back and kill them.

Storm Bow
A +3 damage, +2 THAC0 bow that allows the user to cast Storm Shell once
per day. We found better back in the Temple of the Forgotten God.

Purvis's House (AR9110)
o======================================================================o
5) Leave Emmerick's house and backtrack to the west. Ignore the Temple
of Waukeen (the building northeast of Emmerich Hawk's house) and the
Whistling Gallows Inn (northeast of the temple), and instead enter
Purvis' House (x3350, y=1300) north of Emmerich Hawk's house. Inside,
you will, of course, find Purvis. If you talk to him, he'll just dully
ask if you need a hole dug for a latrine. Yeah.. I remind myself to
remain suspicious of him-a dumb character in town who looks like a
rogue, and carries a Ring of Free Action on him? I don't buy it. Oh! By
the way, you can steal another Ring of Free Action from him. Purvis has
all kinds of other good gear on him, but killing him for it might be a
bit of a spoiler.

Tybald Dunn's House (AR9105)
o======================================================================o
6) Leave Purvis' house and head north to find Tybald Dunn's house
(x=2800, y=400). I guess we better pull that kid out of the well, right?
Head inside and talk to him. Surprise! He has no son. His daughter is a
lying sack of crap. He also doesn't seem too fond of this Baldemar
character-Lonelywood's council representative (as close to a mayor as
you'll find around here). Apparently Baldemar's the one to see around
here.. but first, let's help Tybald get his life on track, shall we?

***ITEMS***
(x=750, y=250) Boots of the North*1

*1: I'd keep these in your inventory if you plan to make a Heart of
Fury run. There are a few occassions where reducing the cold damage
you take will be more useful than the extra point of Armor Class given
by the Boots of the Fox.. like when we're fighting hordes of Cold
Wights, or Frost Salamanders and Winter Wolves..
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Armed with the knowledge needed to thwart little Hailee's tale, head
back to the well and confront the little girl. She throws a tantrum at
being exposed, but at least you get some experience from the whole
affair. You can talk to her some more and find out that Purvis has only
been in town a couple of weeks.. suspicious enough timing.. and that
the owner of the inn bought it for some 'magic mirror' which he can
walk through. Trading Hailee a secret for a secret can lead to some
rather amusing dialogue. Anyhow, now that we have a secret, let's go to
the tavern we ignored earlier-since we have an excuse and all.

***REWARD***
(For exposing Hailee's tale)
EXP	15000

***REWARD***
(For learning a secret)
EXP 	15000

Whistling Gallows Inn, Downstairs (AR9101)
o======================================================================o
8) Head north from the well to find the Whistling Gallows Inn
(x=2250, y=1150). Lovely name. At (x=980, y=420) you'll find a Dwarf
named Roald Tunnelfist, who had a run-in with the barbarians we're
intersted in. He, too, will update your map, if it wasn't updated
already.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) At (x=830, y=430) you'll find a 'Halfling Man' named Hobart
Stubbletoes, who seems to know who you are already. Experienced gamers
know that's never a good sign. If you agree to go with him, he'll take
you away to start the Trials of the Luremaster expansion-which I do not
intend to do at the moment.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Wandering around is the drunkard Ambere Dunn, wife of Tybald and
mother of Hailee-neither of which she is fond of. You can sleep with her
for a reputation loss by promising to take her away from here.. and/or
you can convince her to quit taking her family for granted by repeatedly
selecting dialogue option #1-you'll need 13+ Charisma to get the right
dialogue option to appear, but a humble Friends spell takes care of that
for my pretty-challenged party.

***REWARD***
(For bringing the Dunn family closer again)
EXP	15000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Now that we're done with that.. let's continue chatting up the
drunkards in this tavern. At (x=750, y=420) you can find Murdaugh, who
you can-with a little gold-coerce into singing a tale about love lost
and his abandoned quest for the Glacier Rose. I'm sure this will NEVER
turn up. He's another guy from Auckney, too. If the game puts another
character from that town here, it'll constitute a massive depopulation
of the place. He will also ramble on about nearly everything remotely
interesting, as Bards tend to do.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Finally, there's the owner of this inn. Kieran Nye wanders behind
the bar. Ask Nye what the deal is about the mirror, and he'll ask you to
keep quiet, revealing that he's a former Hosttower Mage from Luskan-not
the friendliest bunch of people. He'll offer you access to premium
magical gear to keep your mouth shut, too. Take him up on his offer and
peruse his wares. Considering that I'm playing a party full of Mages,
it would be a good idea for me to buy as many spells as possible, when
I have the coin... Lastly, you can steal a Ring of Greater Resistance*1
from Kieran. Once you're done shopping, loot the rooms to the southwest
for some of Kiernan's gear. Make sure to go through the secret door
'mirror' at (x=350, y=600).

Dagger of Safe Harbor
This +3 Dagger casts Otiluke's Resilient Sphere on the caster once per
day. Honestly, you're better off with Stoneskin.
  ---
Jamison's Sling
A simple +4 Sling-a definite improvement over anything in the main game.
  ---
Zilzanzer's Magnificent Dart
1d3+2 damage per dart, wielder can throw up to 5 darts/round. Useless.
  ---
Xainlaphar's Flying Skull
Exploding skulls cause 4d8 damage to all within 5' (save for half)
  ---
Thrym Extract
When consumed, the imbiber must save vs death at -4. If successful,
their Cold Resistence is set to 100% for four rounds; if they fail to
save, they take 8d6 damage. Somehow this just doesn't seem worth the
gamble... Thrym Extract Roulette anyone?

***ITEMS***
(x=300, y=600) Robe of the Neutral Archmagi*2
(x=450, y=480) Scroll of Seven Eyes

*1: If you thought its lesser versions were good, feast your eyes on
this beauty. With an Armor Class bonus of two, +25% Crushing Resistance,
and +3 saves vs. spells, it's a truly potent defensive measure for any
character. Unfortunately, it can't be worn with other defensive
measures, but it sure gives the Ring of Protection +2 a run for its
money. At the end of the day, however, I'd rather have +2 all saves than
+3 save vs. spells and 25% Crushing Resistance-Stoneskin gives me all
the physical defenses I really need, but spells... I could stand to
improve against them.
  ---
*2: Like the evil robes we've found, but for more flakey characters.
I have no use for this one, either.

Whistling Gallows Inn, Upstairs (AR9102)
o======================================================================o
13) Now head up the stairs at (x=1100, y=200). Here you can find
yourself a bit of loot if you look around. If nothing else the Rogue
Stone will sell for a good bit of coin. Once you're done here, leave
the tavern.

***ITEMS***
(x=1100, y=970) Rogue Stone, Translocation Arrows x5
(x=480, y=480) 1 gold
(x=600, y=750) Traveler's Robe
(x=350, y=550) Tainted Oil of Speed
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
14) Our next stop is the Temple of Waukeen (x=2300 y=1850), but first,
find Hailee by the well again and talk to her. Tell her to go home,
and convince her.. using one of any numerous means. If you told her the
bear, fish, or barbarian story earlier, you can use those to get her to
go home. If she told you her secret, you can tell her that Kieran is
looking for her. If you're evil you can just threat to throw her down
the well. Finally, if you convinced her mother to go home, you can get
Hailee to head back, too. Anyways, once the brat is gone you'll gain
some experience. Now, onward, to the Temple of Waukeen!

***REWARD***
(For convincing Hailee to go home)
EXP	15000

Temple of Waukeen (AR9103)
o======================================================================o
15) Inside the temple you'll find a Halfling named Quinn Silverfinger
(x=330, y=480). Quinn apparently doesn't like Baldemar, either. Sure.
Mention Tybald Dunn and his business woes to get some good news for
Tybald. Go through the two curtains to reach the back room and open a
secret door at (x=800, y=200) to get at a trapped treasure chest beyond.
Note that you can also buy some pretty premium gear-if you've got a lot
of gold on you. Quinn buys everything-if you need to do some selling-
this is the place to do it. Also note that although you can't steal
anything from Quinn, he does have a Morning Star +4: Defender in his
inventory.

Amaunator's Legacy
This +3 Bastard Sword deals an additional 2d4+3 Fire Damage versus
Undead, has a 5% chance to cast Beltyn's Burning Blood per hit, and
casts Sunray once per day. Not a bad weapon, I just have no use for it.
  ---
Flail of Mae
A +4 Flail that has a 5% chance of casting Flesh to Stone on targets.
Not as important as Three White Doves, but if you have the gold.. well,
I certainly know that I have several characters that would view this
as an upgrade.
  ---
Inconsequence
A +3 War Hammer that acts as +4 versus Good and Evil creatures.
  ---
Kinetic Spear
This +2 Spear has a 5% chance of casting Lance of Disruption on the
target.
  ---
Three White Doves
A wonderful Mace, it's a +3 weapon that deals double damage against
outsiders and undead.. which is a fair number of foes in this game. Not
only that, it has a chance to destroy undead each hit (depending on
their hit dice) and a flat 5% chance to destroy outsiders. It would be a
good idea to grab this weapon if you ever plan to tackle Heart of Fury
mode-or better yet, grab five. In fact, it's a big reason why I
suggested that you specialize in Maces. Of course.. we could always use
Invisosmite instead. I still stand by Maces, however-you know how badass
the Morning Star +4: Defender is.
  ---
Waukeen's Defender
The second best shield in the game, right behind The Argent Shield-or
the best you can do if you're not an Elf or Half-Elf. It gives a +3
bonus to Armor Class, +10% Magic Resistance, and +2 to all saves. The
only reason I put the Argent shield above this is pure math. Each number
on a d20 is equal to about 5%-and saves roll a d20. Ergo, +2 saves is
equal to about 10% Magic Resistance. 20% Magic Resistance on Waukeen's
Defender < 25% Magic Resistance on The Argent Shield. Also, my saves
are pretty good already (especially after spell buffing), and they'll
only get better as I level up more. I'd rather have a good Magic
Resistance AND very low saves, rather than just very, very low saves.
Two lines of defense, and all that, and you can always roll a one on
saves.

***ITEMS***
(x=800, y=200) 1500 gold, Diamond x3, Emerald x2, Quinn's Fancy Sling*1

***TRAPS***
(x=800, y=200)

*1: Fresh into the game and we're already finding weapons that put the
ones in the original game to shame. Let's hope this keeps up. This is a
+3 damage, +5 THAC0 sling.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
16) Now, we've managed to get Tybald's wife and daughter to return home,
and we scouted out some new business opportunities for him.. so let's
return to his house to give him the good news. Good news for every one,
in fact. More business for Tybald, moving somewhere else for Ambere,
and the prospects of an unbroken family for Hailee-and all it took was
six nosey strangers talking to people!

***REWARD***
(For changing Tyblad's fortunes)
EXP	20000

Baldemar's House (AR9106)/(AR9107)
o======================================================================o
17) From Tybald's house head west to Baldemar's house (x=1550, y=700).
Inside you can find his irritable wife, Arden Thurlow, who has a rather
low opinion of her husband, and the house she lives in. When you're done
messing around downstairs, head up the stairs at (x=500, y=500). You'll
find Baldemar at (x=700, y=350), he doesn't have much to say, and what
he does say is riddled with holes. Grab his letter and leave.

***ITEMS*** (AR9106)
(x=530, y=200) Elixir of Health x4
  ---
***ITEMS*** (AR9107)
(x=400, y=270) Council Letter*1

*1: Correspondance from one 'KT' in Targos-sounds like the 'civilized'
folks of Ten Towns were up to no good...

Three D's House (AR9108)
o======================================================================o
18) Exit Baldemar's House and continue west to find the abode of the
three D's (x=350, y=400)-Digby, Dolan, and Doogal, to be exact. These
three hunters/trappers are the boys who have been angering Emmerich
Hawk. As one might expect, they're none too bright. Nothing we can do
about them now, I'm sure they'll be alright in a little while.

Thom Farold's House (AR9109)
o======================================================================o
19) Along the western end of the map, by some boats, you'll find Young
Ned. Nephew of Old Jed. He'll tell you about the nearby boat, and about
the 'three D's' who are causing trouble for Emmerich. Well... that was
fun, now for something more interesting-if only slightly. Head east and
head up a ladder at (x=1070, y=1550) to reach Thom Farold's house.
Speaking of whom, talk to Thom (x=500, y=350) and he'll talk about...
his boats, and the barbarian threat. Bleh. at least there's some loot
to score here. Anyhow, leave the house (x=400, y=600) after you're done
looting. Yay. Now that you've played around in Lonelywood, it's time to
leave. Exit the town on its eastern side. (x=3800, y=1400) will do.

***ITEMS***
(x=400, y=270) Bottle of Wine
(x=480, y=180) Pearl, Light Crossbow, Bolt +2 x40

Barbarian Camp (AR9200)
o======================================================================o
1) Once you reach the barbarian camp a barbarian named Angaar will
speak to you. Ask him for an audience with Wylfdene and one will be
granted.. eventually. When you're done being escorted over to Hengorot,
talk to Wylfdene and ask about him being blessed and guided by Jerrod
for some experience. If you stick to your guns and try and press for
peace, you'll be further rewarded. It's all for nothing, however, and as
Wylfdene is preparing to make a very big mistake by attacking a party
of well-armed folks such as ourselves, Hjollder steps in. He doesn't do
much good, but he does get you out of Hengorot without a fight.

***REWARD***
(For learning of Wylfdene's bonding with the spirit of Jerrod)
EXP	84000

***REWARD***
(For trying to reason with Wylfdene)
EXP	84000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Not much further, however. Once you're back outside, Angaar tells
you that he was ordered to kill you. Ask about Hjollder for some
experience, and avoid a fight for yet more experience (you'll need a
Charisma score of 14 or higher to pull this off-again, Friends will do
the trick). Well, that leaves us with one thing to do, I guess. Time to
head for this cheerily-named Burial Isle. Talk to Angaar again and ask
him some questions to get more information out of him. Note that as a
party we've gained a total of 416,000 experience, or 69,000~ experience
per member without doing a bit of fighting. It seems that-despite the
warning at the beginning of the expansion-the designers wanted to buff
your party up before throwing anything at you. Still not enough, you
say? Very well. Head back to Baldemar's House (AR9106)/(AR9107) in
Lonelywood.

***REWARD***
(For gaining information from Angaar about Hjollder's banishment)
EXP	42000

***REWARD***
(For convincing Angaar not to do battle with you)
EXP	42000

***REWARD***
(For gaining information from Angaar about the assassination attempt)
EXP	42000

***REWARD***
(For gaining information from Angaar about Wylfdene)
EXP	42000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Confront Baldemar about the assassination plot and threaten to
expose him. Keep pressuring him until he admits to it, and details the
plot. Threaten him into going straight for a rather ridiculous
experience reward.

***REWARD***
(For uncovering the plot and convincing Baldemar to come clean)
EXP	420000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Now go talk to Purvis outside at (x=3550, y=1700), who will reveal he
just buried Digby. Hmm.. Steal another Ring of Free Action from him and
go talk to Emmerich. He'll tell you that Digby was probably killed by
the same wolf that attacked him earlier. Oh well, there's not much we
can do for poor Digby right now. The remaining two D's blame Emmerich,
of course, for not letting them trap. Head over to Young Ned and ask him
to take you to Burial Isle.

Burial Isle (AR9300)
o======================================================================o
5) The two most prevelant foes here are Barrow Wights and Ghost Shaman.
The former are melee meat shields with a decent Armor Class and
medicore Hit Points and THAC0. They move quite fast (as if they were
always Hasted), and they'll use this speed to harass party members you
really wish they wouldn't (archers and Mages, for example.) While their
THAC0 isn't too great, it's not bad enough that they won't hit Armor
Classes in the -5~ range too often to sustain. Against your better
Armor Clases, however, they'll need very high rolls, indeed. The latter
can cast a few spells and aren't too shabby in melee, either. As spell
casters, they should always be your first targets. A number of these
creatures lie in wait to the north of you-relatively spread out. This
means that wherever you go, you'll likely suffer attacks from the flank.
In all honesty, my multi-class party chugs a bit against these things.
Their Hit Points and Armor Classes are decent, where they suffer is on
offense. They have about six fewer Fighter levels than a single-classed
Fighter would have.. which means fewer attacks per round and a six
point difference in THAC0. This is quite a slow-down, so to even the
odds, we have to rely on the strengths of our party-which means spell-
buffing. This is not a low-level adventure, so we'll need to spell-buff
at nearly every opportunity. On the plus side, however, the single-
classers only have a few more levels of dominance before they hit the
level twenty power plateau (after which Fighters will gain no more
THAC0), whereas the multi-classers will only continue to close the gap.

***HoF***
Keep Haste up at all times and don't draw in more enemies than you can
handle-same rules as always, really. Again, this is another instance in
which Three White Doves shines, as it'll greatly hasten the smiting
process. In fact, in some of the larger fights, I can't imagine
winning without Three White Doves. It's an immense help to outright
destroy enemies when they're this stong, and even with a small chance
to work, I'd say half the undead here fall to instant-death, rather than
outright damage. In this inital fight, there will be another Ghost
Shaman and more Barrow Wights.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) After the initial batch of undead are redead, you may be able to loot
them for junk arms and armor (the Broken Armor can sell pretty well, if
you sell it in bulk), and Winter Wolf Pelts, which also should be sold
in bulk. Now, there's an entrance to the barrows that tunnel beneath the
island at (x=3050, y=1900), but since it's where we are supposed to go..
yeah, we'll be ignoring it for now. Continue west along the southern
edge of the map and dispatch another group of deaders. Continue west
until You find a tower at (x=550, y=2300). Mysterious! let's explore,
shall we?

Note from Lee:
I expend no special effort to re-endeaden (who are you to tell me it's
not a real word?) the Wights and Shaman - missile fire when I first
encounter them, and melee after they close on the party. I do not move
up to engage, but rather let them come to me, which they will do quite
quickly.

Edion's Tower (AR9301)
o======================================================================o
7) The only thing of note within this tower is the wizard Edion Caradoc
(x=300, y=320). He'll say he's dying, but seeing as he still has some
time left, he might as well do business with you. As he's a wizard, you
can expect him to sell objects of the magey variety. The armor that the
Barrow Wights drop will sell for a bit-especially if you sell in bulk.
The items of interest will be discussed below. He also sells an
impressive selection of Mage spells. When you're done 'shopping', as it
were, head back out into the island.

Bracers of Blasting
Allows the wearer to cast Shout and Great Shout once per day, but has a
10% chance to explode when using Great Shout, doing 4-40 damage to the
wearer. Great Shout sucks, and so do these bracers.
  ---
Cyclocone
Sure, it allows you to cast Whirlwind, but the best thing it does is it
gives you a +1 bonus to Armor Class-and it stacks with other items. Of
course, if you have other gear from the original game (Rogue's Cowl or
Blessed Helm of Lathander) you can safely skip on this item.
  ---
Cynicism
A +4 Long Sword that can cast Find Traps and Knock once per day. If you
don't have a Thief.. shame on you. This sword isn't capable of replacing
one. There are better swords we'll find later, for free.
  ---
Edion's Ring of Wizardry
Doubling 5th level spells sounds like a good idea, and really, you can
never have enough Chaos spells, and Hold Monster and Lower Resistance
are good, too. Still.. I wish it were 3rd or 4th level spells instead.
Most enemies so far have been undead, and 5th level spells aren't really
stellar.
  ---
Girdle of Ogre Blood
You'd think that this item would give you Strength.. like Gauntlets of
Ogre Power, but no, it makes you regenerate. Maybe they got Ogres and
Trolls confused? Anyways, if you haven't made multiple play-throughs of
the main game, you can still make use of this belt. Just give it to a
front-liner. The ability to summon Ogres is a small perk.
  ---
The Shield of the Revenant
By now you've likely found better shields. If not, it's a potential
upgrade from a Large Shield +1, +4 vs. Missiles.
  ---
Ulcaster Academy Ring
The spells this ring grants aren't all that useful, and +2 Save vs.
Spells isn't a huge benefit. Oh, and the fact that it can only be worn
by single-classed Mages only makes it completely useless. Of course,
everybody who played the first Baldur's Gate knows what Ulcaster was..
a low level dungeon where we all learned how to be frustrated at game
mechanics and shitty path-finding. And then we went to the Firewine
Bridge..

8) From the tower back-track to the east, then head north along the
western edge of the map. Find another entrance to the barrows at
(x=1550, y=1750) and from them head west to encounter some Drowned Dead.
They've got a good bit more Hit Points than the Barrow Wights we've been
slaying. Continue to the north along the shore and cross a bridge to
find an undead Shaman named Skaldar. You can ask him about Edion-who the
spirit claims is more dead than alive, and Hjollder-whose location is
unknown to the Skaldar, but he mentions another 'tainted outsider to the
northeast'. He will also talk about some 'foreign spirit' which
possessed one of their chieftans. Certainly these barbarians wouldn't
view Jerrod as a 'foreign spirit', right? If you promise to leave, you
can avoid a fight-but these critters only exist to die. Avoid a fight,
initially, then spell-buff and line up your party members so that each
one of them is facing one of the Ghost Shaman. Each one of my
characters-when spell-buffed-should be able to go one-on-one with these
creatures and prevent them from casting spells. They should all falter
within a few rounds.

Note from Lee:
I had a Shaman and three Wights attack from the southeast while I was
engaged in this fight. Not totally surprised by this, but thought it
was worth mentioning... Again, I used no special tactics here, and I
didn't even bother to spell-buff.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Now head northeast across the wooden platform where we smote the
Shaman, then cross another bridge to the north. Afterwards, head west
to find another tower-this one abandoned-guarded by some Drowned Dead.
Kill them and head back east. Over at (x=2800, y=850) you'll find a
Polar Bear Spirit, who demands that you leave the island, as you
apparently upset the dead. As long as you agree to leave it'll leave you
alone. Whether or not you actually leave is another story. If you openly
defy the bear, he'll summon some Wolf Spirits and Black Bear Spirits.
Be sure to cast Remove Fear before provoking it, as the enemy can use
fear effects. Other than that, however, just be sure to pay especial
attention to the Polar Bear Spirit, as it's rather strong, actually.
Still, a cautious, spell-buffed party should be able to take it down
without too much trouble.

***HoF***
I didn't find this fight too much more difficult in Heart of Fury mode,
just keep on eye on characters as they engage the Polar Bear Spirit, as
he can whittle them to near-death in two or three hits.

Note from Lee:
Haste + Resist Fear and this fight was over before it started.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Continue south beneath a ruined gate, where you'll find more Barrow
Wights, Ghost Shaman, and Drowned Dead. It should be a simple enough
matter to spell-buff and smite them. Once they're dead, rest up and
head into the nearby barrow at (x=1950, y=1100).

Barrows (AR9400)
o======================================================================o
11) As soon as you enter you'll be harassed by some Barrow Wights and
other assorted undead. Wailing Virgins are new-they can use War Cry to
Haste Barrow Wights (as if they weren't fast enough already), Lament-
which will deal a good bit of magic damage in an area of effect, and
Mournful Wail, which acts like a Symbol of Hopelessness (with a much
shorter duration than the spell as cast by the Greater Mummies had,
thankfully). Needless to say, make them dead first-although this task
is made more difficult by the fact that they are 50% resistant to
crushing damage. After everything near where you entered is dead, loot
the nearby urns and sarcophagi, which are both east and west of you. Be
wary of traps.

***ITEMS***
(x=2450, y=780) Horn Coral Gem x12, 153 gold
(x=2550, y=750) Svian's Club*1, 525 gold
(x=2580, y=820) Broken Armor, Elixer of Health,
	        Scroll of Protection from Cold
(x=1700, y=750) Blood Iron*2, 318 gold
(x=1680, y=850) Cloak of Displacement*3
(x=1870, y=750) Battle Axe +1, Chain Mail +1, Arrows +2 x21,
		Water Opal x4

***TRAPS***
(x=2450, y=780)
(x=2550, y=750)
(x=1700, y=750)

*1: Ah, a rare +5 weapon. It would be a consideration for nearly any of
my Fighter/Mage/Clerics, save one minor detail-I have no proficiencies
in Clubs. Yeah, it's a shame, but I long since hedged my bets on Maces,
Flails, and Hammers, which are much more abudant and of higher quality
throughout most of the game.
  ---
*2: A +4 Short Sword that heals the wielder for three Hit Points every
hit. Not bad, but I have no use for it.
  ---
*3: One of the best items you can put in your cloak slot in the entire
game. The saves and Armor Class bonus versus missiles are just
wonderful. My party leader will get this one, and pass it down when we
find better.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) From where you entered head east (by this, you can guess that our
objective is to the west). If you cross a bridge you'll find an exit
out to the surface (x=3700, y=700), which will take us north of where
our Polar Bear Spirit was. That's no fun, so instead, head down some
stairs to the south before the bridge, then head east to find Vexing
Thoughts (x=3070, y=1150). Vexing Thoughts will claim to be a Glabrezu
commander of the si.. yeah, a demon. You can try to dominate it by
saying "I shall command you, Vexing Thoughts!", which will get you Vexed
Armor*1. Of course, the demon gave up a little too easily, didn't it?
If you put the armor on now, the character wearing it will die and turn
into the Demon 'Chalimandren', which will attack. Not so fun. There is
a way to outwit this demon, however. Talk to it, but do NOT try to
dominate it. Once you're done and know who Vexing Thoughts is, you can
cast 'Contact Other Plane' and ask the Planar Spirit what the true name
of the demon that calls itself Vexing Thoughts is. The spirit will tell
you the name and vanish. Talk to Vexing Thoughts again and the unhappy
demon will be bound to serve you, and you'll get the Vexed Armor*2.
Finally, there's a third option. Talk to it, then say farwell without
trying to dominate it. Talk to it again and it'll ask if you want to
enter into its service. Question it about this, and it'll tell you that
you will need to kill an innocent to gain its powers. There are a number
of villagers in Lonelywood that have really good gear (Emmerich, Quinn,
and Kieran come to mind). It's worth killing them just for that gear,
but if you can also appease Vexing Thoughts.. why not? Of course, we'll
need to wait a while to do this, as there are still some rather
lucrative quests involved with some of those characters, and I still
have to do some shopping before this expansion is over. Still, for the
sake of organization, I'll finish this option up here. Once you've
killed your innocents, return to Vexing Thoughts and he'll turn into
the Vexed Armor*3. Do whatever suits you best, but this armor really
isn't that great for a party full of Mages. I get the 2nd version of
the armor, which I fully intend to sell.

*1: With an Armor Class of one, 100% cold resistance, and a +2 bonus to
Constitution, this armor is pretty enticing. Of course, when you put it
on and die it'll seem somewhat less useful.
  ---
*2: Same stats as above.. but all Chalimandren's base are belong to us.
Bound by his name, he can't hurt us and the armor functions the way it
should-uncursed, wearable, non-fatal protective gear. Coolies. Also, it
can be used to cast Fire Storm 1/day, and it can summon Chalimdandren
one time-and one time only.
  ---
*3: Like the suit above, except tainted by your vile misdeeds.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) From where Vexing Thoughts is/was, head south down some more stairs
until you cannot go south any further. To your east you'll find an exit
out of the barrow at (x=3730, y=1900). Head west from this exit and
scatter any undead you find until you find some stairs leading south.
At the bottom of these stairs you'll find a new combo-Wailing Virgins
and Drowned Dead. Smite them and head west along the bottom of the
map until you find another, larger, more diverse group of undead in
need of dismantling. Once they're no longer a threat, continue west to
find some loot.

***ITEMS***
(x=1730, y=1950) Jade Ring, High Quality Battle Axe, Small Shield +1
(x=1530, y=1980) High Quality Bastard Sword, 309 gold
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
14) To the west is another bridge, beyond which.. more of the same
undead we've been smashing. Try not to let them bottleneck you on the
bridge and you'll be fine. Kill them, and any stragglers near the
stairs to the west, then loot another sarcophagus and urns just north
of the western edge of the bridge.

***ITEMS***
(x=1270, y=2000) Scroll of Heal x2, Yeti Pelt, Inferno Arrows +2 x12
(x=1250, y=1950) Young Rage*1, 740 gold
(x=1180, y=1900) Battle Axe +3: Fatigue*2, Fire Darts +2 x20

***TRAPS***
(x=1270, y=2000)
(x=1250, y=1950)

*1: This +5 weapon is nerfed by the fact that it has a 5% chance per
hit of causing the wielder to go berserk.
  ---
*2: Yup, another one. Been a while since we've had a shot at one of
these.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
15) Now head up the stairs to the west to reach the western edge of the
map, where you'll find the tomb of Wylfdene. It's guarded by  a spirit
named Mebdinga (x=550, y=1920), who will initiate dialogue when you
approach. You already know what she's going to say, though. Some tainted
thing infested Wylfdene's body, and this desecration threw all the
undead here into a state. She wants you to leave, and if you don't (or
ask too many questions) she'll attack, along with three other Wailing
Virgins. Pretend like you're leaving to get your party into better
position, then talk to her again to provoke her. Once they're no more,
loot Wyldene's Tribal Insignia from his sarcophagus. This MIGHT just
come in handy sooner or later.

***ITEMS****
(x=450, y=1800) Wylfdene's Tribal Insignia*1, 735 gold

*1: Certainly a quest item, you should probably hold onto it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
16) Backtrack to the east, cross the bridge, and continue east until
you find some stairs leading north at (x=2400, y=2100). They're not the
stairs we took down here originally, but they're pretty close. Once up
the stairs, turn northwest and head up a long wooden ramp. To the west
is yet another bridge, with some Drowned Dead guarding the other side.
Rush the bridge and try to take down the Wailing Virgin up some stairs
beyond the bridge, as she'll just make life miserable for you if you
don't. West of the bridge you'll find another sarcophagus and urn combo
for you to loot (both of which are trapped).

***ITEMS***
(x=200, y=1350) 325 gold
(x=270, y=1370) Scroll of Holy Smite, Scroll of Blade Barrier,
		Moonbar Gem x6, 169 gold

***TRAPS***
(x=200, y=1350)
(x=270, y=1370)

Note from Lee:
I found a Wailing Virgin on the near side of the bridge as well, at
about (x=1700, y=1400)... Bitch!
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
17) Once you're done looting, head up the nearby stairs to the north,
then exit the barrows at (x=300, y=600). Up top, on this isolated little
island you'll find Hjollder. You'll get a huge quest reward for finding
him.. which is fine, considering it actually feels like we've done
something for it this time. Tell him that you suspect that Wylfdene is
not a nice guy, and Hjollder will tell you to find proof. Good news!
We already have it! Show him Wylfdene's Tribal Insignia and you'll get
another huge experience reward. He'll tell you to go find the Gloomfrost
Seer and then whisk himself away. Huzzah! We're done on this stupid
island. Make your way back through the barrow (you'll probably have to
fight some respawns on the way back) and sell or buy any junk from Edion
you might wish to be rid of (or possess), then talk to Young Ned
(x=2830, y=2440) to return to Lonelywood.

***REWARD***
(For finding Hjollder)
EXP	280000

***REWARD***
(For giving Wylfdene's insignia to Hjollder as proof)
EXP	420000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
18) Now, there are some more things to do back in Lonelywood before we
rush off to the Gloomfrost. Find Purvis again (x=3680, y=1720) and talk
to him to discover that another of the three D's is d-d-down. This time
it's Dolan. Steal a THIRD Ring of Free Action from Purvis before you go.
It's time to finish off this murder mystery, and that means we should
go talk to the sole survivor of the three D's.

Note: I've had this quest glitch out on me before, where Kieran simply
would not have the dialogue option pertaining to Emmerich's cure. It
sucks, because that's a lot of experience to lose out on, but it's not
a significant loss otherwise. Also note, however, that after you tell
Emmerich about the curse he will not sell you anything until the quest
has been resolved. I can only think of one possible reason why this
occured.. if you wander around outside of the Whistling Gallows Inn at
night you'll be attacked by a Greater Werewolf. If you kill it (instead
of just injuring it and driving it off) the quest will hang. At least,
that's my hypothesis. If you avoid wandering around at night and hence
avoid the Greater Werewolf entirely, the quest should proceed normally.

Note from Lee:
If you do encounter the Greater Werewolf, simply engage until the point
where it turns back into a regular wolf, then let it run away. This will
also allow the rest of the quest to continue normally.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
19) Head to the three.. er.. Doogal's house and talk to the sole
survivor. He'll tell you about the attack, most interestingly pointing
out that the 'wolf' that attacked him was immune to his non-magical
weapon. Now head to Emmerich's house (x=3000, y=2250) and talk to him.
First, tell him about Doogal's story, and he'll counter by telling you
that Doogal apparently tried to buy an enchanted blade from Kieran.
Return to the inn (x=2250, y=1150) and pay Kieran a visit. He'll tell
you that he sent Doogal away, since he didn't have any such item. Well,
that was a waste of time. Talk to Emmerich again and tell him what
Kieran told you. Reason with him that he *MIGHT* be the Werewolf that's
killing the three D's. He'll come to the painfully obvious realization
that he's probably the murderer. Do not attack him afterwards, instead,
offer to help him remove his curse. So.. back to Kieran again. Ask for a
way to cure Emmerich and he'll give you an amulet 'Selune's Caress'
which will prevent Emmerich from transforming or spreading the curse.
Give it to Emmerich and you'll get another huge experience reward. Whew.

***REWARD***
(For discovering Emmerich is the Werewolf)
EXP	420000

***REWARD***
(For halting Emmerich's lycanthropy)
EXP	420000
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
20) Now sell of anything and everything that Edion wouldn't buy, which
gets me enough money to purchase Three White Doves, Waukeen's Defender,
and the Flail of Mae. I'm not well-equipped enough to use Three White
Doves exclusively as an alternate weapon (after several playthroughs,
I'll use the Morning Star +4: Defender as my main weapon, and switch to
Three White Doves whenever undead show up), but it does let me retire
any and all weapons with less than a +3 enhancement. Also, Eraithul
discards Nym's Rhino Beetle Shield in favor of Waukeen's Defender. Once
the shopping is out of the way, it's time to move on to Gloomfrost.

Gloomfrost, Glacier (AR9500)
o======================================================================o
1) The exterior of Gloomfrost is a pretty big step backwards in terms
of challenge. You'll be fighting the same enemies you fought back in
Wyrm's Tooth, for the most part. Polar Bears, Glacial Yetis, Snow
Trolls, Frost Salamanders, winter Wolves, and the odd Frost Giant.. none
of which really warrant any explanation anymore, do they? From where
you appear head north and kill some Polar Bears. Continue north until
you come to a fork in the path-you can either go southwest, or up to
the north a bit you'll find a larger path to the west. It's a non-
choice, however. Both paths lead to the same area. Crush some Frost
Salamanders and search a campsite for some useless treasure.

***ITEMS***
(x=2400, y=820) Flaming Oil x3
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) From the campsite, head south along the western-most path (the
eastern path is a dead end that has a pair of Frost Salamanders waiting
to die). Along the path you'll find some Snow Trolls-you know how these
stupid things work. By now, I've found enough copies of Melf's Acid
Arrow that any of my four-light armor wearing characters can take them
down. Continue south until there's another fork-the smaller path to the
northeast looks deceptively like a dead end, but it's not. It's just
hiding behind other terrain. Stupid fixed-camera isometric view-point!
Anyways, you'll find Tiernon's Sundered Shield*1 at (x=3200, y=1595).

***ITEMS***
(x=3200, y=1595) Tiernon's Sundered Shield*1

*1: This odd shield gives an Armor Class bonus of two versus all
physical attacks except crushing attacks.. and a 3% resistance to all
physical damage save crushing attacks. As it stands, is not a very
useful item, but you should keep it anyway.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Backtrack to the fork and head down a path to the southwest. Follow
the winding trail west, then north, then back south again. On this
larger, southern-running track you'll find quite a few Winter Wolves,
apparently the pets of a nearby Frost Giant. And by pets, I mean like
Pit Bulls, because they're doing their best to eat the Frost Giant's
face. I honestly don't know why people keep those stupid things as pets.
It's like keeping a Tiger Shark in your swimming pool. This is not a
debate, if you have vicious animals like that in your house, you are
stupid, and I read Dreaming Demon and laugh every time somebody gets
mauled by those animals.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Backtrack to the north again, and head west along a smaller,
elevated path parallel to the Frost Giant/Winter Wolf path. Follow it
south and kill some Glacier Yetis who will show up when you reach a
north/south split in the path. They try to overcome their suck by
flanking you, but you can either not be a wuss and smack them around
with your superior badness, or just backtrack and fight them head-on.
The northern-path is a dead-end, so follow the southern-path, which
splits again into a southern dead-end, and a viable path to the south-
west.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Now, the southwestern path will turn west, then split near a Frost
Giant. This is yet another illusion of choice, the path to the west
just turns north, and loops back to where the first path to the north
leads.. but it DOES provide us the chance to bottleneck our foes for
once. Kill the Frost Giant here and send half you party west, then
north, and leave them where the path bends east. Take the other half of
your party and head up the first, more eastern northern path to find a
group of Winter Wolves. Lure them with your eastern party down to the
path, then flank them with your western party. Or, just kill them, it
really doesn't matter.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Once they're dead, continue northwest from where the Winter Wolves
were to find yet another split, and it's yet another bogus choice. To
the west are some Snow Trolls hovering around a dead Polar Bear, to the
north you'll find an even larger collection of Snow Trolls. There are
several false caves around, but after you've dispatched the Trolls, your
path lies to the east.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) They're running out of places on this map, so don't worry, it's
almost over. From the winding paths where you smote nearly a dozen Snow
Trolls head east, then north, then west a bit to find some more Frost
Salamanders at another freakin' fork. Never fear, however, it's a truly
phony fork. The west is a dead-end, so head north, then east. Kill some
Glacier Yetis, continue east, switch-back west, then northeast to find
the entrance to the next area (x=1250, y=350), finally.

Gloomfrost, Ice Caves (AR9501)
o======================================================================o
8) Once inside, head east until the path turns southeast, then south.
Notice the holes in the ice? Looks like it was melted, not mined, right?
You'll find out why soon enough, when you're attacked by a Remorhaz,
a Dungeons and Dragon's staple. Essentially, it's a big ass bug-like
creature with a really hot ass. They've got plenty of Hit Points, but
their Armor Class is some of the worst we've seen amongst new foes in
this expansion, and their THAC0 is rather mediocre. If they hit,
however, it can hurt a lot (they deal 6d6 Crushing Damage and have a
5% chance to deal a whopping 10d10 fire damage on each hit-which can
instantly kill any of my characters), so try to bring them down as
quickly as possible. If you face multiple Remorhazes at once, focus on
bringing them down one at a time. Remorhazes are the only foes in this
level, and I really can't recommend wasting offensive spells on them-
they are 75% resistant to magic. Just spell-buff and chop them down.
It's blunt tactics at its worst, but it's what works. The only trick
they have is to ambush you, so take it slow, and consider keeping a
sneaking character behind the party to make sure you don't have any
Remorhazes sneaking up on you.

***HoF***
I must admit, I thought Remorhazes would be much more trouble in Heart
of Fury mode than they actually are. That is, I expected them to nearly
kill one of my fighters in one hit, instead they take two or three, and
that's hardly anything new, is it?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) From where you first encountered some Remorhazes, turn west, killing
bugs as you go. Then head south and follow the next tunnel to the east,
where two Remorhazes will ambush you from behind, and another will come
up the tunnel in an attempt to flank you. Continue east, then kill some
more Remorhazes to the south. Turn west, and.. yeah, you get it. Ignore
the false cave at the end of this tunnel, but spell-buff here before you
head south. Once buffed, go south and lure the Remorhazes to the north.
They're big, you're small, you can bottleneck them easily before they
can enter the chamber with the false cave-it's a better option than
running into their chamber and getting flanked. When all the immediately
visible Remorhazes have been lured north and slain, head into the
southern room they were occupying-with the spiral ice formation and the
Remorhaz egg clutch. Another Remorhaz will show up and attack from the
northern room we vacated-but on its own, it's no match for us. Find a
tunnel heading east out of the the southeastern edge of this room and
follow it. Smite two Remorhazes insolently blocking your path, then
continue along the path as it turns north and destroy another four bugs.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) From the last four Remorhazes, head north, then follow the tunnel
as it turns east, then north, then west. There are now two paths open
before you-an area transition to the north (x=2600, y=50), or the forge
of the 'Blind Dwarven Smith' (x=3280, y=620). He'll warn you not to harm
the Seer, and tell you that she forsaw her death due to you. Pick
whatever dialogue options you want, and he'll offer to craft a mirror
for you, which will allow you to gain  access to the Seer.. of course,
being blind and all, he'll need your help with the project. Since it's
necessary to continue on with the game, agree to help him and you'll get
a 'Mirror of Black Ice*1'. Score. There's more he can do for you,
however, which we'll discuss in the next several steps.

Note: If you talk to him with a Dwarven character, you'll have heard of
Tiernon before-a famous Dwarven smith of the Hearthstone clan. Likewise,
if you're a Bard you'll also be able to identify him. Either way, you'll
earn a small experience reward for it.

***REWARD***
(For identifying Tiernon)
EXP	26250

*1: Nobody should have an attention span this short, but really, keep
this in your inventory. You'll be needing it soon.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) If you have it in your inventory, Tiernon will sniff out the Blade
of Aihonen when you try to end the conversation. He'll inform you that
its singing is off-apparently he hears something we don't. Must be that
whole sensory compensation due to sensory deprevation thing. He'll beat
it back into shape and you'll obtain the Singing Blade of Aihonen*1.

*1: This blade still is +1, +5 anytime you're anywhere in the game, but
it now provides +30% resistance to fire and cold, +10 to maximum Hit
Points, and it allows the user to cast Cure Critical Wounds three times
per day and can grant a +3 bonus to Strength once per day. The best
sword we've found so far is now even better.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Now, this next item should be obvious-we found the old guy's shield
out in the snow! Talk to him and ask about the dented shield you found
and he'll repair it for you, giving you back the Sundered Shield of
Tiernon*1 when he's done.. although it's a good bit less sundered..
Isn't it odd how the name changes from Tiernon's Sundered Shield to
Sundered Shield of Tiernon? Continuity issues, Black Isle?

*1: Now this is better. It gives an Armor Class bonus of three and +10%
resistance to all physical attacks. Also, it allows the wielder to
give themselves a +2 Armor Class bonus and +15% resistance to physical
attacks once per day. I'd rather have the permanent magic resistance
from the Argent Shield, however, as Stoneskin is superior physical
resistance to whatever this shield provides. Still, I daresay it is
superior to the Reinforced Large Shield +2.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) The next request is pretty obvious-if he can make a mirror, why not
a rose? Because one is a flat plane and the other is a complicated,
multi-layered, delicate flower! Nah, seriously, he's fine with it, just
lend him your eyes and he'll give you 'The Ice Rose*1'.

*1: Murdaugh will absolutely love to get his hands on this, don't you
think? Of course, if you don't get your hands on it, you'll never be
able to give it to him right?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
14) One more item left to get-you can now ask about his eyes, and ask
what he's doing in the Gloomfrost. You shouldn't be surprised to learn
that they're taking another play from the R.A. Salvatore playbook.
According to him, Dwarven smiths eventually have a 'calling' in their
career, a quasi-religious experience where they hit the pinnacle of
their craft. For R.A. Salvatore's purpose, this was when Bruenor made
Aegis-Fang for Wulfgar, and luckily enough for us, with our help Tiernon
will hit his apex by making us a weapon of our choice. You can make one
of the following five weapons:

Hand of the Gloomfrost
A +4 Two Handed Sword that gives its wielder +10% Fire Resistance,
+10% Cold Resistance, allows the wielder to cast Storm Shell once per
day and has a 5% chance to cast Suffocate on foes (as the 7th-level Mage
spell). This is the best Two Handed Sword in the game.
  ---
Kiss of the Gloomfrost
A +4 Long Sword that gives its wielder +10% Fire Resistance, +10% Cold
Resistance, allows the wielder to cast Storm Shell once per day and has
a 5% chance to deal 2-12 Cold Damage. There are several superior Long
Swords in the game.
  ---
Fist of the Gloomfrost
A +4 Mace that gives its wielder +10% Fire Resistance, +10% Cold
Resistance, allows the wielder to cast Storm Shell once per day and has
a 5% chance to deal an additional 1-10 Bludgeoning Damage. It's not the
best Mace in the game, but it's better than many of the weapons my poor
Fighter/Mage/Clerics are still stuck with. I replace the Flail of Mae
with this weapon, as its petrifaction effect is making me rather
uncomfortable. Nobody wants to lose loot due to it.
  ---
Fang of the Gloomfrost
A +4 Dagger that gives its wielder +10% Fire Resistance, +10% Cold
Resistance, and it allows the wielder to cast Storm Shell and Anti-Magic
Shell each once per day. I'd stick with the Mage Dagger +4.
  ---
Tongue of the Gloomfrost
A +4 Halberd that gives its wielder +10% Fire Resistance, +10% Cold
Resistance, allows the wielder to cast Storm Shell once per day and has
a 3% chance to cast Cone of Cold on the target. All things considered,
I'd rather have the Hand of the Gloomfrost-it's random spell doesn't
have any potential for friendly fire.
  ---
If you are a Dwarf, you can make all the weapons above, plus the
additional weapon:

Blood of the Gloomfrost
A +4 War Hammer that gives its wielder +10% Fire Resistance, +10% Cold
Resistance, allows the wielder to cast Storm Shell once per day and has
a 5% chance of healing the user for 2-12 damage. It's a decent weapon
for my party.. but I don't have any Dwarves, and Fist of the Gloomfrost
is superior.
  ---
Finally, if you are a Druid, you can make the following weapon:

Talon of the Gloomfrost
A +4 Scimitar that gives its wielder +10% Fire Resistance, +10% Cold
Resistance, allows the wielder to cast Storm Shell once per day and has
a 15% chance of entangling the target.

***REWARD***
(For aiding Tiernon in creating his life's work)
EXP	80000
Item	Gloomfrost Weapon
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
15) Finally, you can make purchases from Tiernon. The more interesting
items he sells are listed below. Once you're done shopping, exit via
the northern boundary at (x=2600, y=50).

2H Axe of Greater Phasing +2
Nobody likes Two Handed Axes, and this +2 version is painfully mediocre
by now, even with its +15% chance of phasing targets and +25% chance to
deal +1d4 Cold Damage.
  ---
Battle Axe +2: Defender
We found one of these in the Dragon's Eye-and now we have access to
another. Of course, we've outgrown this by now, right?
  ---
Boots of the North
We might want six pairs of these for Heart of Fury mode.. of course,
if you plan to play through things six times, you'll get all of these
boots you need for free.. but having them now will give some of your
characters extra things to wear for the initial playthroughs.
  ---
Full Plate Mail +1
Another great suit of armor, we found one earlier, but a suit of armor
with a base Armor Class of 0 should always be worth mentioning. My
party, however, has no use for it.
  ---
Long Sword +2 'Varscona'
Don't look now, it's another Baldur's Gate 1 weapon! In fact, it's the
best sword from that game-our old friend carried by Grey Wolf. You know,
"None cross Grey Wolf and live!"? He was picking on a Bard, who was
carving an image of Ellesime, the Elven queen from Baldur's Gate 2?
Ah, I'm just showing off my gaming knowledge. This weapon is ass, save
for the nostalgia.
  ---
Scimitar +3: Frostbrand
Yeah, another repeat, he's got alot of these.. maybe for players who
imported characters into the game without playing through the main game?
In any event, if you need Scimitars, this is one of the better ones in
the game.
  ---
Short Sword +2: 'The Whistling Sword'
Another Baldur's Gate cross-over! It's just a crappy nostalgic weapon.
  ---
Throwing Axe +2
Another weapon we've previously found (and probably sold), it's still
a decent ranged weapon with infinite ammo for single-classed Fighter-
types.
  ---
War Hammer of Phasing +3
Perhaps the only weapon worthy of purchasing for my party-it's a +3
War Hammer that has a 15% chance to phase the target and a 25% chance
to deal +1d4 Cold Damage. It's possibly a successor weapon to Misery's
Herald.
  ---
Winter King's Plate
An interesting suit of armor that has a base Armor Class of three, it
also gives a +25% resistance bonus to cold and fire. It can also be worn
in tandem with other magical protections! Unfortunately, it doesn't
allow Mage spells, so it's not really worth a long-term investment.

Note from Lee:
You can pickpocket Tiernon for an item called 'Tiernon's Hearthstone',
which, if you're a Dwarf, allows you to Resist Fire and Cold 1x/day,
cast Burning Hands 1/day, and nullify the effects of fatigue 3x/day. If
you do this, and then talk to him again, he'll call you out for
pickpocketing him, but allow you to keep the Hearthstone anyway.

Seer's Domain (AR9502)
o======================================================================o
16) Here you'll find Ice Golem Sentries, which aren't as lethal as they
might seem. They have a better Armor Class and THAC0 than Remorhazes,
but less Hit Points and they deal considerably less damage (a mere
1d10+9 damage, which is nothing compared to the absurd damage of a
Remorhaz). Their only saving graces are the fact that they can attack
faster and have a 10% chance to stun when they hit-which can be very
problematic-again, like the Bombardier Beetles, it ignores your Rings
of Free Action. I know, stun is not paralysis-but dammit, it should be.
Anyways, from where you appear head east, then turn south, then south-
west. Disarm a trap at (x=1300, y=1150) and continue southwest to find
your first trio of Ice Golem Sentries. Smite them, get your feet wet,
this level will be like the last-lots of walking and killing and little
looting.

***HoF***
The Ice Golem Sentries are still a pain. They take more abuse than the
Remorhazes did, and if they stun you, things can go bad quickly. I'd
suggest not getting involved in fights with more than three of them at
once, and if you get into a situation where you have to-spell buff. My
characters-when fully buffed-have an Armor Class of -23. It makes a
difference.

Note from Lee:
This is an awesome place to grind for experience - at 14000 each, the
Ice Golem Sentries will respawn 2-3 at a time seemingly forever...

***TRAPS***
(x=1300, y=1150)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
17) Ignore the lame and empty room to the south and continue to the
west. When the path turns south again, cautiously head into the room,
as there are a number of Ice Golem Sentries around that would love to
swarm you if you give them the chance. Try to lure them back north and
smite them. When done, continue south and disarm the trap at
(x=450, y=2000). Just south of the trap there's another ambush waiting.
We can pull off tricks we've abandoned since the Severed Hand again-
namely sneaking forward, triggering ambushes, and luring baddies back
to the party to be destroyed on our own terms.

***TRAPS***
(x=450, y=2000)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
18) Once the ice is inanimate again, turn east and explore until the
tunnel forks. First, let's deal with the northern fork. Disarm a trap at
(x=1100, y=2500) and lure two Ice Golem Sentries down from the northern
room and smite them. Now continue east to find.. another fork! Don't
worry, it's a phoney fork, as both paths lead up the same way. There
are traps in both, and an Ice Golem Sentry in the eastern path. Either
(or both) way(s) you go, disarm, destroy and you'll wind up in a
larger chamber to the north, where three more Ice Golem Sentries
await.

***TRAPS***
(x=1100, y=2500)
(x=1800, y=2180)
(x=2550, y=1750)
(x=2400, y=2050)
(x=2300, y=1500)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
19) Once this room is safe, spell-buff and head to the southeast,
where you'll find another large chamber, inside of which are several
Ice Golem Sentries. There's another perfect bottle-neck opportunity
that you should take advantage of, and with spell-buffs you should
wipe the floor with this host of Golems. Once they're dismantled, enter
the room in force. You'll find a rather out-of-place Remorhaz in a
cubby. Smite it, disarm a trap (x=3580, y=2080), and head north along
the eastern side of the area, follow the tunnel northwest, disarm
another trap (x=3150, y=1300), and continue along, killing the last
few Golems in the level.

Note from Lee:
The Remorhaz dropped an amulet called 'Kossuth's Blood', which reduces
spell casting time by 2 and increases damage from fire attacks by a
whopping 20%. Not bad for killing a Remorhaz that can't defend itself.
I replace the Amulet of Metaspell Influence that my main Mage was still
wearing; at level 16, he has more than enough low level spells, and the
ability to cast faster far outweighs the extra spells.

***TRAPS***
(x=3580, y=2080)
(x=3150, y=1300)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
20) At (x=2700, y=200) you'll find your way blocked by some ice. Of
course, with the Mirror of Black Ice handy a doorway will reveal itself.
Continue past and find the Seer (x=3250, y=320). She will initiate
dialogue, and tell you a bit of what you already know-she's been here
hiding from you, as you are the harbinger of her imminent demise. Of
course, that makes no sense. If fate is really fate, it's immutable,
and it would have been just as pointless hiding here as it would be
living a full, comfortable life of her choosing. Or better yet, if you
could forsee your own death, why not jump into a volcano, just to test
it out? I know, there's lots of bad things that can happen to one short
of death.. but still. There's bound to be better places to wait for it
than a freakin' bug-and-golem infested glacier. Anyways, enough ranting!
She'll also tell you that the mirror you used to get here will force
whatever is possessing Wylfdene to assume her true form. Yeah, I know
she said she hid here to prevent the thing possessing Wylfdene from
finding her, but she knows WE herald her doom, so hiding serves no
purpose-this natural fortress is nothing but a self-inflicted prison.
She'll then to proceed to babble about the bogus special sense women
don't have (if you talked to her with a female protagonist, anyways).
It's all just a weak analogy to express that there's no reasoning with
the creature behind Wylfdene, which we know by now is (or was) dead,
is proud (vain), is female, and very, very angry. After she has given
you the mirror (and you gained the first experience reward listed below)
try to reason her into overcoming her fear (dialogue options #1, #1, and
#1) to get another, equally awesome experience reward. Afterwards, you
can test out her visions by questioning her further, whereupon she'll
vaguely talk about female characters from the main game, and will make
another rare Planescape: Torment reference (if you don't own the game,
buy it. If you haven't played it yet, you're an incomplete human being.
You have an awesome RPG-shaped hole in your heart, and only Planescape:
Torment can fill it.) When she's done babbling, she'll teleport you out
of this level and back to the Gloomfrost exterior, which saves some
time.. or she can take you to Tiernon, if you must talk to him again.

***REWARD***
(For learning Wylfdene's weakness)
EXP	280000

***REWARD***
(For trying to reason with the Seer)
EXP	280000

Hengerot (AR9201)
o======================================================================o
21) Fight the urge to return to Lonelywood right now-there's nothing new
going on there. Instead, head to the Barbarian Camp again and talk to
Angaar (x=650, y=420). It's not too hard to convince him to grant you a
second audience with Wylfdene. Get the possessor of Wylfdene to look
into the mirror for some quest experience. The Seer shows up and gets
herself killed, (note that Wylfdene curses Aihonen.. if you are astute,
you'll remember that Aihonen died fighting a Dragon) after which all
hell breaks loose, as the Wyrm Tribe Warriors go hostile and attack.
Never fear, however, as the Elk Tribe and Bear Tribe will help you fight
off the Wyrm Tribe. Kill the Wyrm Tribe Warriors and loot the Seer for
a cloak*1.

***REWARD***
(For exposing Wylfdene and revealing the dragon queen Icasaracht)
EXP	84000

*1: The Wailing of Virgins is the best cloak in the game, bar none. It
gives a +4 bonus to Armor Class versus Crushing, Piercing, and Missile
attacks, and a +2 bonus versus Slashing attacks. It also makes the
wearer immune to fear-based effects, Emotion: Hopelessness and Symbol
of Hopelessness-wretched spells that come up later on in the main game,
as I'm sure we all remember. It also lets the wearer cast Cloak of Fear
once per day.. which is.. who cares? Still, the Armor Class bonus and
spell immunities make it the best thing to wear in Heart of Fury mode.
It's a cursed item, but why would you ever want to take it off anyways?

Barbarian Camp (AR9200)
o======================================================================o
22) When you're done in Hengorot, head outside (x=750, y=900) to
continue the fight. Once all the Wyrm Tribe Warriors are dead you'll
get some experience for helping the Elk tribe win out. Outside of
Hengorot you can find Beornen (x=3220, y=620), who will tell you about
this wyrm-of course earning you some juicy experience-and will offer to
take you wherever the Wyrm went. Decline for now, and loot the area,
instead, as it has plenty of decent loot just waiting to be claimed.
Hjollder is over at (x=1150, y=550), and he'll tell you were he thinks
the wyrm's spirit fled. Always with the virgins, isn't it? One would
think they'd just put out to avoid this sacrifice nonsense. Anyways
decline his offer to go after the Dragon, too. We need to return to
Lonelywood, first. In fact, head over to Lonelywood now!

***ITEMS***
(x=3400, y=1000) Halberd of Sparks +1*1
(x=3290, y=1290) ~Ogrien's Scale*2
		 (7th Play: Cloak of Invisibility*3)
(x=700, y=2450) Reinforced Large Shield +1, Studded Leather Armor

(x=1940, y=900) Potion of Magic Shielding, Potion of Fortitude

***REWARD***
(For learning the identity of Icasaracht, the Dragon matriarch)
EXP	120000

***REWARD***
(For helping the tribe of the Elk prevail)
EXP	300000

*1: Didn't we find one of these at the beginning of the game? Garbage!
Why am I commenting on it? One of life's great mysteries..
  ---
*2: Another suit of armor that is deceptively lack-luster. With an
Armor Class of two, it's nearly as good as the Black Swan armor. Of
course, it's ability-Animal Rage 3/day-is pretty lame, but it can be
worn along with protective items. At the end of the day, if you were
intrigued by the Winter King's Plate, you might be intrigued by this
armor. It's one point of Armor Class versus 25% resistance to cold and
fire.
  ---
*3: It lets you use Invisibility three times per day. Frankly, however,
it's more a novelty item than a constant defensive item. I have a
Fighter/Mage/Thief who can sneak just fine, and six Mages, all of whom
will be able to just cast Invisibility. I have no need of this cloak.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
23) Go visit the Whistling Gallows Inn one last time. Give Murdaugh the
Glacier Rose you found for a whopping experience reward. What nice folks
we are! Once that's done, talk to Kieran, rest, and spell-buff heavily
before you leave in the inn. Once outside, you'll be bothered by a
wizard named Vaarglan, who will ask if you seen a former collegue of
his. If you rat Kieran out, some mercs will Dimension Door in and go
assault the inn-although things won't turn out in their favor. If you
play dumb or outright provoke them, you'll get the pleasure of killing
them yourself. More importantly, you'll get all their loot if you kill
them yourself.. and they will give you the best single-battle drop of
loot in the game, as you can see below. How do I deal with them? Besides
spell-buffing to the max before leaving, once I'm outside and I've
picked a fight, I have Syrenil cast Chaos, Ilnathias casts Slow, and
my other four Fighter/Mage/Clerics all cast Silence 15' Radius. After
that, I target Vaarglan, then Alpheus. After those two are dead, I
simple step on the remaining mercs. Enjoy the great haul of loot, and if
that's not good enough, go talk to Kieran, who will thank you for
standing up for him.

Mercenary Warrior: Full Plate +1, Large Shield +1, Long Sword of
Action +4*1, Gauntlets of Weapon Expertise*2, 74 gold.

Mercenary Warrior: Full Plate +1, Gauntlets of Ogre Power*3, Battle
Axe +3: Fatigue +3*4, 32 gold.

Priestess of Shar: Shadowed Plate Mail Armor*5, Fast Flail +2*6,
42 gold.

Mercenary Thief: Short Sword of Backstabbing*7, Boots of Stealth*8,
Studded Leather +4: Shadowed*9, 99 gold.

Vaarglan: Robe of the Neutral Archmagi, Ring of Free Action*10,
Golden Girdle*11, Ring of Protection +2, Barrier Amulet*12, Wand of
Paralyzation, 113 gold.

Alpheus: Mage Robe of Fire Resistance, Bracers of Defense A.C. 6, Amulet
of Metaspell Influence*13, Potion of Magic Shielding, Potion of Extra
Healing x2.

***HoF***
Another battle that didn't turn out as bad as I thought it might. I
spell-buffed in the tavern, and on the first round shot out five
Symbols of Hopelessness.

***REWARD***
(For giving Murdaugh a Glacier Rose)
EXP	630000

***REWARD***
(For protecting Kieran from Hosttower assassins)
EXP	630000

*1: The best Long Sword in the game. This sword is a +4 weapon that
grants an extra attack per round, a +1 Armor Class bonus, and 15%
slashing resistance.
  ---
*2: +1 THAC0 and +2 damage is pretty damn awesome. In fact, they're the
best gauntlets in the game, as their bonus is patently superior to the
+1 THAC0, +1 damage I'll get from the Gauntlets of Ogre Power (see
below). There IS an alternative setup to my equipment, more offensively-
oriented. Instead of using the Shimmering Sash and these gauntlets
(which gives me +1 THAC0, +2 damage, +3 Armor Class, and +1 to all
Saves), you can use these paired with the Girdle of Stromnos (which
would give you +2 THAC0, +4 damage). I prefer the defensive route,
myself.
  ---
*3: Gauntlets that raise your strength 18/00. If you're lucky (or
patient) you can just roll a character with a natural 18/00 Strength..
but my patience has its limits, and I could only be bothered to spend
so many hours generating these characters. As it stands, they all have
Strength scores of 18/91+, so they'll only get a +1 THAC0, +1 damage
bonus from these gauntlets.. inferior to the Gauntlets of Weapon
Expertise, above. Still, I have lots of Fighters to equip, so these
will certainly find themselves a home.
  ---
*4: A third one! This game loves Battle Axes.. but not as much as
Icewind Dale 2 does..
  ---
*5: If you didn't find one in the Severed Hand, or if you just want
another, it's never a bad thing to have 0 Armor Class armor with a +3
bonus Armor Class modifier against missiles. Kaelinalia gets rid of her
Full Plate Mail +1 and wears this, instead.
  ---
*6: We had a chance to score this much, much earlier in the game. It's
a +2 weapon, so it's undesirable now, but it's still almost enticing,
since it gives an extra attack per round.
  ---
*7: It's really just a +3 Short Sword with a speed factor of 0. By now
I've sold better weapons.
  ---
*8: The Shadowed Boots are better, but we were really hoping for better
drops than that. In any event, my Fighter/Mage/Thief is glad to finally
get rid of those Quiet Boots that I found all the way back in the
Orc Caves outside of Easthaven..
  ---
*9: It has a better Armor Class bonus than the Black Dragon Scale,
+30% Stealth, and 20% resistance to piercing, slashing, fire, and
electricity.. it doesn't look as cool, nor does it have the +2 Saves
versus Spells, but I still dub this the ultimate Thief armor.
  ---
*10: Our sixth Ring of Free Action-we no longer need any more, thanks to
the three we were able to steal from Purvis, earlier. We could equip all
our characters with them, but honestly, the biggest incentive to wear
these was to make use the multi-Web attack early on. Now, these things
just prevent us from Hasting with most (if not all of) our party. The
defensive benefits just aren't worth the offensive costs anymore.
  ---
*11: If you have the Girdle of Stromnos or Shimmering Sash, you can
ignore this girdle. I, however, have plenty of empty belt slots in my
inventory, so this ends up going on Kaelinalia.
  ---
*12: It might seem useful at first glance-an amulet that allows its
wearer to cast Stoneskin and Minor Globe of Invulnerability, but since
it can only be used by a Mage (who can just cast the spells themselves)
it's really not worth using.
  ---
*13: Again, I have plenty of empty amulet slots, so this can certainly
find a home somewhere.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
24) One more loose end to tie up-you should have noticed that Purvis is
gone. Where oh where could he have gone.. why not look in Baldemar's
house (x=1550, y=700) for no particular reason? Inside, you'll notice
that Arden Thurlow-Baldemar's wife is dead. Yikes! Head upstairs and
enter Baldemar's room. You'll discover that Baldemar is equally dead-no,
wait, maybe even a little bit MORE dead than his wife. Dead isn't an
absolute, there are levels. Anyways, Purvis will appear in the corner
and monologue the tiresome way all would-be villians in this game do.
They just love their expose. Anyways, apparently Purvis was the REAL
assassin sent to take care of Wylfdene, but Baldemare is a moron and
sent some random stranger, instead. Once the one-eyed dolt botched the
job, the barbarians got wise to potential assassination attempts and
increased security.. making the job all but impossible for him. Once
we got rid of Wylfdene, however, his job was done-the only thing left to
do was get rid of everybody who might know better-Baldemar, for
instance.. and you. He'll promise you'll meet again and run off. Hmm..
Leave Baldemar's house, and once you're back outside Purvis will show
up and attack. He wasn't joking, eh? No special tactics apply, Purvis
is a push-over. Kill him and loot him for some Boots of Stealth, a
Cloak of Non-Detection, yet another Ring of Free Action (this makes
four, courtesy of Purvis), a Short Sword of Backstabbing, an Oil of
Speed, and 87 gold. None of his gear is terribly great anymore, but
it'll sell well.. and I throw the cloak on Syrenil just for fun.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
25) Last chance to do whatever else you care to do in this expansion;
this typically means-shopping! Sell whatever items you want to get rid
of, buy anything and everything you want (and can afford).. or, just
keep all that loot you have stashed. If you start a second playthrough
of the game, it's going to waste all your money-but not your loot. If
you want to have plenty of cash at the beginning of your second run-just
sell off accumulated loot at the beginning of the next game. Finally,
before you go, one more thing of interest. You're now done questing in
this expansion, there's no returning to town after you leave.. so if
you want some of that awesome loot the NPCs in Lonelywood have, now's
the time to kill them and take it. Don't worry about the reputation hit,
because it doesn't really matter too much at this point in the game,
does it?. The interesting NPCs are as follows, in case you forgot when
I mentioned this earlier:

Emmerich Hawk (AR9104): He's troublesome to kill, as he'll hide on you
and vanish, and he can be pretty brutal with that bow of his (especially
on harder difficulties!) surround him with as many melee Fighters as
possible, spell-buff to the max, then attack him. He's not terribly
well-protected by Hit Points or Armor Class, you just have to finish
him off quickly before he runs. With any luck, he'll drop almost
immediately. When he dies he'll leave behind a Finest Long Sword,
Confusion Arrows x20, Arrows of Piercing x20, Inferno Arrows x20, a
Shadowed Cloak*1, Bracers of Archery*2, a Long Bow +4: Hammer*3, and 100
gold. Yeah.. it's all about that bow.

Quinn Silverfinger (AR9103): Quinn is much easier to smite, just walk up
and smash him. Once he's dead, help yourself to his Bullets +2 x40,
Sling +1, Morning Star +4: Defender*4, and 100 gold.

Kieran Nye (AR9101): The only trouble with him is that you'll have to
decimate the entire bar to get his loot-which isn't too much trouble,
considering some of the other characters also have drops worth getting.
Just go after Kieran, first, as his spells make him the top threat. When
he falls, loot him for a Ring of Greater Resistance (if you didn't
steal it, earlier), a Mage Dagger +4*5, a Potion of Extra Healing, and
54 gold. I really don't suggest looting him, as the gains are relatively
minor. Plus, if you kill Hobart (a consequence of starting a fight with
Kieran or the other patrons) you won't be able to start the Trials of
the Luremaster dungeon pack this playthrough.

Murdaugh (AR9101): You'll have to dispatch him along with Kieran, in the
Whistline Gallows Inn. He drops a Long Sword of Action +2.

Roald Tunnelfist (AR9101): Another bar patron, he drops a Battle Axe +2:
Defender, Chain Mail +2, and 16 gold.

Hobart Stubbletoes (AR9101): The fourth and final barfly that you must
swat, the instigator of the 'Trials of the Luremaster' dungeon pack. He
will drop a Light Crossbow of Speed*6, Leather Armor +1, Gauntlets of
Dexterity*7, Short Sword +2: 'The Whistling Sword'.

*1: We could have found one of these in the Severed Hand. It gives a
+15% bonus to stealth.
  ---
*2: Bracers that give a +2 bonus to THAC0 with ranged weapons. Syrenil
will gleefully strap these.
  ---
*3: By far the best bow in the game-it's a +4 bow (with +5 THAC0),
gives the user four attacks per round, and an Armor Class bonus of
one.
  ---
*4: We need five of these wonderful, wonderful weapons-and we can get
two per game. This is the second such item we had a chance to get to
get, and I must whole-heartedly insist that you grab it. Amirule will
happily wield this weapon, making my two front-liners truly fearsome
foes.
  ---
*5: Another Mage Dagger +4. It's a pretty awesome weapon, but really,
Syrenil has since found a supreme Long Bow and Long Sword, along with
an upgraded Blade of Aihonen.. this seems somewhat less special now.
  ---
*6: A +1 damage, +3 THAC0 Light Crossbow that gives an extra attack
per round. It's nothing compared to the Repeating Heavy Crossbow we
could have found earlier.
  ---
*7: One of the most wonderful defensive items in the Baldur's Gate
games.. in Icewind Dale, all my characters already have an 18 Dexterity,
ergo, this item is just a novelty.

Anyways, kill who you want to kill, loot what you want to loot. When
you're ready, return to the Barbarian Camp and talk to Hjollder or
Beornen and go to the Sea of Moving Ice.

***TRIALS OF THE LUREMASTER***
We still have a whole dungeon pack to deal with-Trials of the
Luremaster, which can be started by talking to Hobart. If you head off
to the Sea of Moving Ice, you won't get a chance to start it this
expansion. I struggled for a bit as to where to put this expansion in
the guide, as chronologically now is the ideal time to start it. On the
other hand, it involves a significant detour from the Heart of Winter
expansion, and worse yet, it's not a terribly common expansion, as far
as I know. The first time I encountered it was when I purchased the
Dungeons and Dragons Anthology released by Atari, and it was certainly
released after Heart of Winter. Since it breaks up the Heart of Winter
expansion, and since some gamers may not even have the game, I've
decided to simply finish up the Heart of Winter expansion, export my
party at the end of it, restart Heart of Winter, and immediately talk to
Hobart. If you want to start it now, go ahead and skip to [WLK028], if
not, you can just do what I did and come back after Heart of Winter.
There's not much significant loot at the end of Heart of Winter, so
players finishing off that expansion won't really have an edge over
those who don't. On the other hand, Trials of Luremaster is brimming
with loot, and it was certainly designed as a greater challenge than
Heart of Winter... probably due to the chronology of their release
dates. You wouldn't release a lower-level expansion AFTER a higher one,
right? Anyways, continuity, challenge, and convenience for the common
gamer are the reasons I'm citing for putting the Trials of the
Luremaster expansion later in the guide.

Tribe of the Great Wyrm Island (AR9600)
o======================================================================o
1) You'll arrive in a humble camp set up on an island-I hope you weren't
expecting civilization or anything. You can talk to Beornen
(x=520, y=2230). He'll tell you a bit of useless information about
Icasaracht, and will refuse to take you back to the mainland or heal
you, if you ask. What a useless prick. Jorn is at (x=750, y=1820),
although he's hardly any more useful. He will, at least, heal you if
you ask (for a price, of course). So, lots of useless, greedy
barbarians, little information, no way back. Sounds fun. Loot the camp
and take the stock of Flaming Oil as a sign-there's Trolls ahead.

Note from Lee:
I still carry the Flaming Long Sword +2 to deal with Trolls. At this
point in the game they aren't much of a threat, and this thing, while
all but useless in other battles, really does the job versus Trolls.

***ITEMS***
(x=600, y=1900) Flaming Oil x4
(x=580, y=1950) Flaming Oil x5
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Head north, then east, and as soon as you make your way through a
narrow pass you'll be harrassed by Trolls-Greater Ice Trolls and more
obnoxiously, Greater Snow Trolls. The latter, of course, take fire to
keep down. My prefered tactic here is just to use Melf's Acid Arrow-as
many of them as it takes. I have plenty of Mages. They drop minor
garbage-Winter Wolf Pelts, gems.. skulls? You have no way to sell
anything anymore, so why bother picking anything up unless you plan to
sell in during another playthrough-the implication here, of course, is
that it should be expensive. There are plenty more Trolls to the east-
including Scrags, which are aquatic Trolls that fortunately do not
require special tactics to keep down. I suggest luring them all back
through the natural bottleneck to the west, as there really are quite a
few, and they can get out of hand if you let them swarm you. I use
Syrenil for this purpose-running around throughout the level-alone-and
leading Trolls back to the party. Once I've got a sizeable horde in the
bottleneck I hit them with Slow, which makes melee easier and, again,
Trolls affected with movement-affecting effects like Slow or Web tend
to stay down if you kill them in melee, regardless of whether they
normally require fire or acid or not.

***HoF***
The bottle-neck lure is, in Heart of Fury, somewhat more essential.
Of course, with higher level characters I have no qualms about throwing
around Incendiary Clouds to make sure Trolls that fall stay dead, and
Trolls that are waiting in the bottleneck suffer for it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Once you've exterminated as many Trolls via bottleneck as you care
to, explore to the eastern edge of the level, then turn south and follow
the path around to a wrecked ship guarded by Scrags. They take no
special action to destroy, so smite them and loot the ship.

***ITEMS***
(x=1800, y=1700) Namji's Robe*1

*1: A robe with an Armor Class of five and surprisingly fast
regeneration of one Hit Point per round. Since it's not as protective
as the Robe of the Watcher, and it can only be worn by single-classed
Mages, it's useless to me.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Backtrack to the bottleneck and from it head north, staying as far
west as you are able. Eventually you'll find a ramp to the south, where
you'll encounter several Bergclaws-uh.. bear-like critters. Return back
up the ramp and continue up some stairs to the northeast, where you'll
find a door guarded by two Ice Golem Sentries. When you get near the
door, they'll attack, so set your party up in a favorable way before
provoking them. Once they're dead, enter the doorway at (x=1100, y=400).
I spell-buff before entering.. just in case there's a mob of bad guys
on the other side.

***HoF***
From here on out, you might as well ditch the Boots of the Fox and wear
Boots of the North, instead. Many, many creatures from this point on
until the end of the expansion will be doing cold damage, and cutting
that in half will help a lot. Or, again, there's always Resist Fire/COld
and Entropy Shield.

Arctic Caverns (AR9601)
o======================================================================o
5) As soon as you enter you'll be attacked by a vertiable menagerie of
arctic enemies. This encounter will pretty much set the tone for the
rest of the level.. everything icey and lame lives here, including
Greater Snow Trolls, Greater Ice Trolls. New-comers include Bone
Scavangers (Wyvern-like foes) and Berg Yetis.. which are like normal
Yetis, except tougher and they have a cold breath weapon.

Note from Lee:
Once again, I don't bother buffing or applying an special tactics. My
party is simply too powerful for these foes, and I take them all out in
straight melee.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Once you've wasted the wintery welcoming party, continue to the
west. My strategy for this place is really quite simple-I spell-buff
with my longest-lasting, non-fatiguing spells, and proceed to walk
through the level crushing everything in my path. These buffs include
Prayer, Draw Upon Holy Might, Recitation, Protection from Evil 10'
Radius, Emotion: Hope and Emotion: Courage. If a large number of foes
present themselves, I use Slow to help out.. and of course to cheaply
kill Snow Trolls. Round a corner to the south and smite another large
collection of baddies.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Continue east, kill another group of arctic misfits, then turn
south again-this is the expansion where the developers coil the levels
as much as possible to waste your time and fit plenty of lame encounters
into each map. At this second turn, however, you'll find a corpse you
can loot. Huzzah! Loot, continue west, cross a bridge, and exit to the
next level at (x=200, y=1100). Again, spell-buff before you enter the
next level, in case-against all odds-the inhabitants of the next area
turn out to be uninterested in tea and cookies.

***ITEMS***
(x=1370, y=920) Cloak of Invisibilty*1, Flaming Oil x7
		(7th-Play: Ogrien's Scale)

*1: Yeah.. this container pretty much has the same stuff in it as one we
found in the Barbarian Camp. Two shots at the same loot-if only any of
it were any good.

Note from Lee:
I rested here just before entering the next area (one of my multi-class
Mages gained a level and need to memorize spells), and was attacked by
four Sahuagin. They died so easily they almost aren't worth mentioning,
but what's the point of a FAQ if you don't tell people what can happen?

Field of Bones (AR9602)
o======================================================================o
8) You'll face some pretty stiff resistance once you enter the level.
Spell buffing will make this fight easier, but the real annoying
elements, again, are the Snow Trolls interspersed amongst the foes,
which require especial fire-or-acid attention in order to keep down.
Then there are the Water Kin Elementals, which you'll have to kill with
spells or missiles, as you can't approach them in melee. As far as new
enemies are concerned.. they're not too bad. They can do a good bit of
damage if they hit (cold damage, by the way), but they're otherwise
unimpressive. My advice? Keep a leash on your characters, don't let
them advance freely through the level-drawing the attention of every
critter they can. Kill what's in front of you, then advance, and let the
enemies come to you-luring a mob of Greater Snow Trolls will just cause
you grief.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) After the initial baddies are dead-including the Water Kin Elemental
in the pool to the west, head south to find.. more freakin' Trolls.
Further south are more Scrags and another pool with a Water Kin
Elemental within. Waste them, then continue east and head onto a narrow
ledge crossing a chasm. Some Trolls will harass you from the south-
eliminate them and continue east, across the chasm. I suggest leading
with one well-protected character wearing Boots of the North and leaving
the rest of your party on the western side of the void.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) On the eastern side of the crevice you'll encounter a few new foes-
Cold Bones, which are just normal get-in-the way skeletons, and Frozen
Bones/Iced Bones, which can be pains in the ass. They can cast a variety
of cold spells-Snilloc's Snowball Swarm, Icelance, and Ice Storm. If you
haven't guessed already, the sole goal of this place is to pummel you
into submission with as much cold elemental damage as possible, and at
this, they excel. Take their initial spells (you really don't have much
of a choice in it), lure them across the bridge spanning the hole, and
eliminate them. Once all is still head across the gap with your party
and destroy any Bone Scavengers around. Once they're all dead-good
news! There's plenty of goodies to loot amongst the remains in their
lair.

***HoF***
The undead here can be obnoxious, what with their constant use of cold
spells. Anything that hurts you without having to make a 'to hit' roll
is not healthy for you. Fortunately there's relatively few of them
around, and Three White Doves helps to make them fewer. Also, cold
spells are easily negated with our Clerical buffs.

***ITEMS***
(x=3150, y=1100) 524 gold
(x=2700, y=900) Wand of Lightning
(x=3150, y=700) Chain Mail +2, Amulet of Protection +1, 1000 gold
(x=3400, y=1020) King's Tears, Emerald
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) From the Bone Scavenger nest, head south to find-more undead. Deal
with them in whichever way you find the least painful, but keep your
looting glasses on, as there are more goodies hidden amongst the remains
nearby. In the southeastern corner of the map you'll find the third-
and final-Water Kin Elemental in this level.

***ITEMS***
(x=3250, y=1710) Potion of Hill Giant Strength, Potion of Heroism,
		 Ancient Armor
(x=2900, y=1600) Potion of Magic Blocking, Ring of Protection +2,
		 Ring of Infravision

*1: Gives the wearer Infravision.. which makes things glow orange. This
is not a dark game, so I can't see why you'd ever need this.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) From the final Water Kin Elemental's pond, head southwest and
destroy another collection of Cold Bones and Frozen Bones. Cross a
narrow path to the northwest to find the remains of a very large, and
hopefully very dead dragon. Explore to the north of the dragon's head
first and smite some Bone Scavengers. Once they're dead, search the
rib-cage to score some premium loot.

***ITEMS***
(x=1600, y=1700) Mithral Field Plate Armor +2, Cloak of Protection +2,
		 Gauntlets of Ogre Power*1, Large Shield +1, Bastard
		 Sword +1, +3 vs. Shapeshifters*2

*1: A second pair of these gauntlets. Ilnathias has the superior
Gauntlets of Weapon Expertise, Amirule is still using the Guantlets of
Elven Might/Girdle of Stromnos combo, and Kaelinalia has the first pair.
So, surprisingly, these get passed all the way down to Nauzhir.
  ---
*2: How many Werewolves and Dopplegangers are there in this game? Yeah,
like one. How many superior +4/+5 swords have we found? More than one.
How many characters do we have that can use them? One. By process of
elmination, this is identified as a hunk of crap. Scientifically, even.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) Now explore south of the dragon skull to find a Sahuagin priestss
named Xactile wandering around, guarded by some Boneguard Skeletons.
Wonder of wonders, she's not hostile! Talk to her and she'll identify
this place as the 'Field of Bones', where the dead are laid to rest.
She claims to be a priestss of Sekolah, but he seems more on the Myrkul
side of things.. She'll tell you were Icasarcht is, and ask you not to
pursue her-not for the dragon's sake, but for the sake of her former
people, who guard Icasaracht. Well, at least it's not more damned
Trolls. She won't force the issue, however, and will actually heal you;
for a price. At least this makes sense, though, unlike those asshole
barbarians. Loot her (trapped) altar and head bravely onward to the next
level (x=600, y=2100).

***ITEMS***
(x=1000, y=2220) ~Ring of the Will-o-Wisp*1
		 (7th-Play: Mourner's Armor*2)

***TRAPS***
(x=1000, y=2220)

*1: This unimpressive ring allows you to shoot out 'a spray of
electrical motes' that deals 4-16 damage to 'everything in their path'.
I can honestly say I never even bothered to use this stupid ring.
  ---
*2: I love Lamellar armor.. Chain Mail, Plate Mail, even the Lorica
Segmentata (Roman-style Banded Armor) are all staples of the fantasy
genre, poor Lamellar labors in anonymity, even though it was vastly
superior to Scale Mail and even Chain Mail in terms of protectivity,
maintenance, and affordablity. Anyways, this armor it interesting, if
not useful-it's got a base Armor Class of four-which is hardly passable
for Fighter armor anymore (if indeed it ever was). Also, it's cursed,
but it's one of those 'Wailing of virgins' type deals-if you're wearing
it, you probably want to be wearing it-it's not a 'gotcha!' curse. while
equipped, it gives the wearer +25 Hit Points.. but it also hides your
Hit Point total. It also gives a +75% resistance to Missile weapons and
immunity to pain. It can be worn by Thieves (albeit, at a -25% penalty
to their Thief abilities, but at this point in the game, you probably
have enough points to survive it), but you do not retain your Mage
spells with this armor. Even if you retained your spells, the hidden Hit
Points are a killer. I simply refuse to micro-manage that much.

Sahuagin Lair (AR9603)
o======================================================================o
14) As soon as you enter this level you'll be attacked by some hulking
Umber Hulk-like critters known as Vodyanoi-fish people. They're nothing
special. A Sahuagin behind them will shoot at you while you melee the
Vodyanoi, and another Sahuagin will cast low level Clerical spells-do
not give in to your violent urges and attack them, as they are protected
by traps. Disarm them, THEN let violence reign. There is a similar
encounter in the room to the north-a trap lurks at the arches to the
north, and a Water Kin Elemental in a pool beyond, so don't rush on in.
Ilnathias presents himself as a target just south of the arches, while
Syrenil shoots down the Sahuagin, the elemental, then disarms the trap.
Teamwork! Continue north through another room and you'll get yet another
similar encounter-traps at the arches, Vodyanoi lead in melee, a
Sahuagin hangs back and casts spells/shoots at you. This time, however,
you can loot some objects to the northeast which seem to be where the
Sahuagin process their fiery bolts. On that note, Sahuagin will drop
their mundane weapons, Bolts, Bolts of Sekolah's Fire (3d6 fire damage
for three rounds), and possibly some gems or jewelry-all garbage that
serves only to clutter up your inventory.

***ITEMS***
(x=1700, y=630) Bolt of Sekolah's Fire x2
(x=1870, y=680) Bolt of Sekolah's Fire x3
(x=1980, y=720) Bolt of Sekolah's Fire x2

***TRAPS***
(x=1650, y=1420)
(x=1750, y=1240)
(x=1700, y=940)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
15) The only way we can go now are through the arches to the west-each
arch is trapped, of course, so do yourself a favor and disarm the traps
under each arch.. you know, while you're not being harassed and all.
Once done, head to the west, where the level opens up a bit. Running
northwest are three paths, each guarded by Ice Golem Sentries and
trapped. The Golems are, for now, non-hostile, so we'll ignore them
for the moment. To the Southwest are two more rooms set up like
the first three chambers we cleared-Vodyanoi, Sahuagin, another Water
Kin Elemental, and traps in the arches, of course. You know how to deal
with these by now. Once those rooms are cleared, disarm the traps
under the Golems.. or at least all the ones you can reach.

***TRAPS***
(x=1450, y=1260)
(x=1520, y=1100)
(x=1400, y=920)
(x=1300, y=1000)
(x=1220, y=930)
(x=1200, y=1345)
(x=1150, y=1100)
(x=1000, y=1220)
(x=920, y=1260)
(x=900, y=1180)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
16) Time to evict these stupid, lazy, fat Golems, for the dire offense
of being in our way! It's one of the rare instances in an Infnity
Engine game where you have to start a fight with a neutral foe in order
to proceed. Since the ball's in our court, we might as well spell-buff
up. I then have Syrenil take some pot-shots at the middle Golem, while
she and the rest of my party stand back in the room where we entered.
The Golems, predictably, attack, as well as a host of Sahuagin hidden
behind them in the northwestern part of the level. They try to come
through the arch and naturally bottleneck themselves in front of the
room. I show off my party's might a bit here by hitting them with
multiple Greater Commands, Chaos, and Slow. A few Sahuagin will break
off and enter the room from the room to the north, but by the time they
reach my party most of the Sahuagin are incapacitated. I slaughter the
few who miraculously managed to save, then tend to those who didn't.
Once done scraping scales off your boots, there are some more Water
Kin Elementals that manifested since you provoked the Golems. I deal
with them the traditional way-Ilnathias standing around dumbly getting
attacked to no avail, with Syrenil behind him shooting the critters
down.

Note from Lee:
Instead of the room where we entered, I move into the room just went of
that (as there is only one entrance) and bottleneck the golii, etc, in
the archway to (x=1200, y=1300). This prevents them from flanking me,
and allows me to simply kill them one at a time...
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
17) You're not done yet-chances are you didn't lure everything in the
level eastward in the last Step. After taking care of the two Water
Kin Elementals near the northern and southern Golem-guarded paths I
advance with Ilnathias up the center path (after disarming the trap,
of course) where he'll encounter a batch of Sahuagin Elite Guards and
another Water Kin Elemental. They'll shoot uselessly at him, he
retreats and lures the Sahuagin Elite Guards back to the first room,
where we dismantle them in detail-I don't get bottlenecked, I am the
bottlenecker! Once done, it's a simple issue to shoot down the Water
Kin Elemental. Sahuagin Elite Guards drop Shark Skin Armor*1 and
Spears +1, in addition to the typical Sahuagin crap.

*1: Base Armor Class of eight, +10% Fire and Acid Resistance, -1 penalty
to Dexterity.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
18) One more encounter awaits. There are three more traps behind where
the Golems were, and northwest of the pool/paths the Golems were
guarding is a semi-circular ring of Sahuagin, Sahuagin Elite Guards,
and a Sahuagin Prince. They WANT us to come to them, and while we
could avoid bottlenecking ourselves by splitting the party up and
taking different paths, I prefer to simply hit them with a pre-emptive
spell-barrage. First, Syrenil makes herself Invisible and disarms the
traps impeding our progress. Once that's done, I sneak up with Syrenil,
mark the locations of the enemies, and target the ground in front of
them with Greater Command and Chaos spells, then I charge in and
massacre them gleefully. All but two of them fall asleep, which makes
the process of elimination that much easier. Once they're dead, loot
them for some goodies, especially their prince, who will drop Coral
Plate Armor*1, a Cloak of Protection +1, a Plain Key*2, and a Spear.
Loot the urns along the wall and enjoy that oh-so-pointless bit of
end-game loot.

***ITEMS***
(x=1000, y=550) Debian's Rod of Smiting*3
(x=820, y=520) The Icon of Power*4
(x=720, y=600) Lover*5
(x=630, y=570) Pestilent Dawn*6
(x=470, y=670) Sceptre of Tyranny*7
(x=360, y=850) The Unstrung Harp*8

***TRAPS***
(x=1100, y=900)
(x=900, y=900)
(x=850, y=1100)

*1: Armor Class three, +15% Fire and Acid Resistance, -2 to Dexterity.
It's a good bit inferior to normal Plate Mail, much less the enchanted
gear on most of my characters.
  ---
*2: Another quest item. You might want to hold onto it for a few
moments, yes?
  ---
*3: A +3 Club that deals extra damage against Golems and outsiders.
Golems aren't too troublesome, and the fact that you only have a 5%
chance to deal extra damage makes it less useful than other weapons
we've already found.. like Three White Doves, which has a 5% chance
of destroying such foes outright!
  ---
*4: A +3 Halberd with the ability to cast Symbol of Pain 3/day. There
are better Halberds out there, and I don't care about them, either.
  ---
*5: Lover is a +4 Dagger that returns to the wielder's hand. Fair
enough, we found a Battle Axe that does the same thing a long time
ago... but this is a +4 ranged weapon, not a mere +2 weapon. The biggest
problem with ranged weapons was, of course, the limited ammo. The Long
Bow +4: Hammer is far, far superior-(-1 THAC0, two attacks per round on
Lover versus -3 THAC0, five attacks per round with the Long Bow +4:
Hammer), but Lover does Piercing damage, while bows do Missile damage,
which is more frequently resisted. Ultimately... I keep my hands on
both. Lover can be deployed against anything that requires highly
enchanted weapons to hit, and the convenience factor of not having to
carry around ammo is priceless. The Long Bow +4: Hammer is retained to
do brute-force slaying against less well-protected foes. Of course, in
later playthroughs, if you really want to use an archer you should
consider  just getting a mod that allows you to infinitely stack arrows,
and buy  yourself enough magical arrows to last you for the game. It's
really untenable without cheating (so purists, use Lover, instead.)
  ---
*6: Pestilent Dawn is a +4 Morning Star that has a 25% chance to inflict
disease and makes the wielder immune to disease. It could have
potentially found a home in my party, but alas, good characters cannot
use it. Just as well, Three White Doves is better anyways.
  ---
*7: Sceptre of Tyranny is a pretty neat Club. Its +4 enchantment bonus
is powerful, and being immune to fear is always good. Unfortunately I
don't have any club-users in my party.
  ---
*8: Bards are pretty useless, and this forces you to have a good-aligned
Bard with 13+ Wisdom. What do you get in return? The ability to cast
Heal once per day. By now, my Clerics can do this more often, and many
other things besides.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
19 The doors to Icasaracht's lair are at (x=1400, y=450), but before we
enter, activate the object at (x=1200, y=750)-which will explode in a
Snilloc's Snowball Swarm effect.  Apparently this was a preservation
ward that kept a young dragon body fresh. There was another one on the
other side of the level, but it's curiously already been deactivated..
Oh well, no time to think. Now it's time for the most intense spell-
buffing session yet. I cast the following spells-Resist Fire/Cold and
Entropy Shield, and Draw Upon Holy Might on all my Clerics and Prayer,
Recitation, Emotion: Hope and Emotion: Courage, Protection from Evil 10'
Radius, Haste, and Righteous Wrath of the Faithful on the rest of the
party. In addition, Ilnathias takes his place as a super-phenom by using
my oft-mention by as-of-yet seldom-seen super-combo. He'll cast
Stoneskin and Tenser's Transformation. Unfortunately, he's the only
character I have that's equipped to do it.. still, it only takes one.
Once I'm fully buffed, Head through the doors to get this over with.

***REWARD***
(For destroying the preservation ward)
EXP	10000

Icasaracht's Lair (AR9604)
o======================================================================o
20) You'll be confronted by Icasaracht the dragon-certainly getting
big dragons on the Infinity Engine was the crowning glory of Bioware.
Unlike in Baldur's Gate 2, however, here they take the role here they
deserve: the end boss. The dragon will talk about its motives if you
let it, but a fight is inevitable. Now for some notes about dragon-
fighting. Unlike in Baldur's Gate 2, Icasaracht doesn't have dragon
fear, so you don't need to buff with Remove Fear. Also unlike Baldur's
Gate 2, Wing Buffet here isn't quite as annoying-it'll deal a bit of
damage and can stun you briefly, but it's far less effective here. Then,
of course, there's the dragon breath, which can do some pretty brutal
damage in an area-of-effect. By now we have items and buffs to protect
us from cold, and her breath weapon is, of course, cold damage. Most
of all, however, dragons are brutal in combat, and can whittle down a
single character somewhat quickly. If, however, you spell-buffed as I
advised earlier, her breath weapon will do marginal damage, and with
the Armor Class of my party ranging from -12 to -24, there was only so
much she could do in melee.. especially since Ilnathias for the first
time in the game saw fit to break out the almighty Tenser's, and was
protected by Stoneskin. There's only one hair in the ointment-she'll
be assisted by a number of Sahuagin-paltry, on their own, but if any of
them cast Dispel Magic, Icasaracht will become much more dangerous.
Still, on the normal difficulty it's simple enough to just run up and
smite her with my fully-buffed party. When she dies, pat yourself on the
back and.. well, you're not quite done yet.

She's a sneaky dragon, and if you talked to her, you'll remember that
she has been trying to play the immortality ticket. If you destroyed
the preservation device in the previous Step, she obviously doesn't
have a body to go to, but she does has a Soul Gem, where her spirit
retreated to after you smote her physical form-and there are still
Sahuagin milling about. Her Soul Gem needs to be destroyed, but first,
if you're ambitious, crush the Sahuagin facing you, which include
Sahuagin Royal Guards, Sahuagin Underpriestesses, and a Sahuagin King.
Retreat to the eastern edge of the level (where you entered) so you
can kill them without having to subject yourself to the spells the
Soul Gem will cast. When the King falls, spare a moment to run over
and loot him, as he'll drop a Cloak of Displacement, Gauntlets of Ogre
Power, Bolts +2 x5, Coral Plate Armor, a Heavy Crossbow +1, a Spear +1,
and a Pearl. The Sahuagin Royal Guards drop Shark Skin and Coral Armor
and normal Sahuagin junk. (This gear isn't included in my final party
stats, since I recorded it prior to the fight with Icasaracht, but it
will sure be nice to have on the next playthrough (honestly, it doesn't
make sense to record gear you won't have before you face the final boss
of the game, does it?) Anyways, once the Sahuagin are dead focus on the
Soul Gem. Vodyanoi will continue to harass you from time to time, but
they're really only checking to make sure you haven't fallen asleep.
Unless you are very unlucky or you barely got past Icasaracht, this is
no fight at all. It'll cast annoying debuffs on your like Chaos, Horror,
Dire Charm, Blindness, Slow, Stinking Cloud, and Feeblemind, and once
most of those are depleted, it'll resort to Snilloc's Snowball Swarm,
Ice Storm, Acid Storm, and Shroud of Flame. After that, it has nothing
else it can throw at you. Once it's smote, the doors out will open and
you'll get a nice beefy experience reward (which is also not recorded in
my final stats). If you plan to tackle another playthrough or the Trials
of the Luremaster dungeon pack, now is a good time to export all your
characters. Once you're done, head out the doors (x=2250, y=1250) and
end the game.

***HoF***
You need to spell-buff to the max before entering the chamber with
Icasaracht-that should be no surprise. Still, even with a titanic party
there's only one saving grace in this fight-the Tenser's combo. The fact
that all of our triple-classers can use Improved Invisibility, Mirror
Image, Haste, Stoneskin, and Tenser's gives them the defenses needed to
survive against Icasaracht, who will kill even the strongest of Fighters
with stunning speed. As soon as the chatter ends, engage Icasarcht. Once
her Sahuagin show up, have all your Clerics hit them with Symbols of
Hopelessness and hope for the best. They are not much of a threat by
themselves, but if they dispel my spellbuffs, I'm toast, so I need to
really make sure to get the Underpriestesses down. If they are thwarted,
there should be no problem killing Icasaracht, who just doesn't have an
answer for the Tenser's combo. If your spell buffs are stripped, make
sure to get another Stoneskin up at least, and perhaps recast Tenser's
if things aren't out of hand. Once the dragon falls head over to the orb
as usual-almost every time I've done this fight my Symbols of
Hopelessness dominate the Sahuagin, taking them out of the fight in
short order. Once Icasaracht falls, and the Sahuagin are disabled, it's
a small matter to run up and destroy Icasaracht's Soul Stone.

Note from Lee:
Okay, so I spell-buffed this time, pretty much as described above. The
fight itself was disappointing though - after having fought "real"
dragons in the Baldur's Gate series, this thing was really no more
challenging than anything else in the game. He went down in about four
rounds, and the Soul Gem in another four - really not all that tough.
I simply ignored everything except those two targets, and it was over
before I knew it.

***REWARD***

1) As I mentioned above, I completed Heart of Winter in its entirity,
exported my part after defeating Icasaracht, and restarted Heart of
Winter. So... if you're following this guide, you're either at the end
of Heart of Winter, before going out to the Sea of Moving Ice, or you've
already beaten Heart of Winter and restarted (like me!). Either way,
we're in Lonelywood again, and our goal is now the same-head over to the
Whistling Gallows Inn (x=2250, y=1150) (AR9101) and talk to the
'Halfling Man' (x=830, y=430) named Hobart Stubbletoes. He's got a great
little adventure for you to go on-although he's sketchy on the details.
Agree to go with him and he'll cast a 'Teleport Without Error' (wish we
had that...) and you'll be whisked away with magic sauce.

Note: For those of you who are restarting Heart of Winter, as nature
certainly did not intend, there's no crime against talking to Quinn and
buying some choice items.. say, Waukeen's Defender and another Three
White Doves? This can be done handily by selling off all the gear we
found at the end of Heart of Winter. Stealing another Ring of Greater
Resistance from Kieran, grabbing Quinn's Fancy Sling, and other quick
stops before visiting the Whistling Gallows Inn are also worthy of
consideration. I did NOT do this, myself, however. It's some odd
gaming purity thing I have.. Despite the fact that I started this
expansion over again, I wanted all my gear and experience to have come
soley from one run through the game. There's no reason why you shouldn't
loot up, however.

Castle Maluradek, Courtyard (AR9700)
o======================================================================o
2) You'll reappear quite far from the climes of Icewind Dale. Apparently
this castle Hobart wants us to explore is in the Anauroch.. a very
large desert. So, from snow to sand we go. No matter what you say, he'll
end up insulting your intelligence and wandering off. We should follow
him-but before you do, you'll be attacked by Harpies and Fiendish
Harpies. They're somewhat potent in melee, but we all know our
mythology, right? Well, apparently Black Isle didn't want to code Charm
effects into their song, so instead they cause fear. Cast Remove Fear
quickly and smite them. Fiendish Harpies are a bit tougher, but their
combat stats can't really compare to yours. They also can cause disease,
so keep an eye out for it. Once they're dead, head into the house at
(x=1450, y=850).

Hobart's Shack (AR9715)
o======================================================================o
3) Talk to Hobart (x=260, y=160), who says little of interest. He is,
however, our one and only merchant in this expansion, so let's see what
he's got, eh?

Bag of Holding
Yes, it actually is a Bag of Holding. No joke-you put crap in it, and...
well, stuff is in it. As far as I know, it's bottomless, so have our
prayers for inventory management been answered? No. Prayers are never
answered. There are two limiting factors to this item; first, it will
not store any armor-be it Robes of the Evil Archmagi, Full Plate +1, or
any kind of shield-if it uses the shield or armor slot, you cannot put
it in the Bag of Holding. Second, like all containers, it will NOT
export with you, meaning you can only use your Bag of Holding for the
rest of Trials of the Luremaster... and for Heart of Winter, when Trials
of the Luremaster is completed. Of course, we all know we found a Bag
of Holding, so again, if you want to cheat and give yourself one on a
subsequent playthrough... well, it's only so much cheating, since there
is no logical reason why you can take your badass Morning Star +4:
Defender with you, but not your Bag of Holding.
  ---
Bracers of Icelandic Pearl
These bracers are only usable by Mages-which restricts nobody in my
party. Too bad they're just Bracers of Defense A.C. 6 with a few once-
per-day spells attached (none of which I bother using, by the way). They
also impose a -2 Dexterity penalty, so all things considered, they're
LESS protective than humble Bracers of Defense A.C. 6.
  ---
Cloak of Protection +2
Noteworthy only for being uncommon, I haven't been able to find a home
for cloaks like this for a long while now.
  ---
Gauntlets of Ogre Power
In case you didn't get enough in Heart of Winter... have another one!
It'll give me minor bonuses to THAC0 and damage, but it's better than
nothing. Of course, this would be our fourth pair... so there's a good
chance you won't be able to make much use of it.
  ---
Golden Girdle
If you don't have belts on some characters, you might as well buy this.
It's not a great item, but something is better than nothing.
  ---
Short Bow of Ebullience
Remember how I told you that Short Bows suck? I stand by that. This is
one of the very few decent Short Bows in the game, and damn, does it
come late. On my first, niave, uninformed guide party, I had Syrenil
cast as a Thief/Mage dual-class. The best bow she got all game was a
laughable Short Bow +1. Compared to that, this +3 specimen seems
inspired... even with the -2 Constitution penalty and -50% Fire
Resistance penalty. Of course, it also has a 25% chance to deal +2d3
fire damage, makes an extra shot per round, and gives the user +30% Cold
Resistance, so it's not all bad. It aspires to be a decent Troll-killer,
but by now I've discarded all ammo-using weapons and settled for
Lover... or I just stack arrows and use the Long Bow +4: Hammer, which
is vastly superior.
  ---
Skullflail
One of the few decent items Hobart sells-the Skullflail is a +4 Flail
that always deals +1d4 piercing damage, and has a 10% chance to deal an
additional +1d6 piercing damage. It's not amazing, but at least it
doesn't have any gimps.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Buy what you will and leave-it's time to explore the courtyard-which
well explore.. almost at random. You'll find Harpies around, and
Wyverns. The former cause fear, and the latter poison you. With an over-
abundance of Clerics, neither should be much of an issue. Good news!
They are not friends. North-west of Hobart's shack you'll find a group
of the two critters fighting it out. Aid them in their attempts to kill
each other. Once they're dead, talk to the 'Spectral Figure' at
(x=800, y=400).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) 'Lo and behold, 'tis the Luremaster! Why does he have that name? He
didn't lure us here. Shouldn't Hobart be the Luremaster? Whatever, he
melodramatically announces himself as your adversary... freakin'
Bards... Anyways, he tells you that you must enter the 'lure' and prove
yourselves worthy of 'bearing the mantles of heroes'. Oh... I get it-
this place is the lure, and he's the master of it-hence, the Luremaster.
Oooooh... Anyways, if you succeed, you get to leave, if you fail,
well... Then you can still export and do something else! Loser
Luremaster-game mechanics fail is fail. Anyways, before letting you go
he'll give you a riddle, which you don't need to interperate, because
you long since gave up any autonomy by reading this FAQ. Still, to humor
us both:

"North, east, south, and west,
 In towers four the purgatives rest.
 Feed them where the spirits nest,
 Or forever here remain, our guest.

 The sun rises, the earth warms,
 Four men lie cold, yet no one mourns.
 "Leave them be!" the mad lord warns,
 and from my work their praise is shorn."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) So.. there are four towers around that we need to explore, and deal
with the 'purgatives' within. Purgative... hmm..

Purgative: adjective, 1) that purges; purging 2) causing bowel
movements- n. a substance that purges; specif., a cathartic.

Hey! I learned a new word. So, we have to 'feed' some purgatives
(clearly the noun form), in some towers 'where the spirits rest'... a
play on purgatory? Kill some purging agents-guardians-in some towers.
Well, that wasn't too hard, was it? So let's get on it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) First, I choose to explore the eastern side of the level. Head east
of Hobart's shack to find some pesky beetles-including some Bombardier
Beetles, Boring Beetles, and a Rhinoceros Beetle-easy prey by now. Smash
them, then head up the stairs. They look broken, but should you stand
near the ruined planks long enough, you'll see through the illusion and
be allowed to proceed-don't worry, this kind of thing doesn't happen
elsewhere in the expansion. Head up the stairs (x=1900, y=600) to reach
the eastern walls.

Castle Maluradek, Eastern Walls (AR9710)
o======================================================================o
8) Yes, the walls are a seperate area, hence, a location seperator.
I know, it's lame. Kill a pair of Fiendish Harpies to the south-east,
then note the two towers at either end of the wall, the northern tower
is at (x=100, y=100), and the southern tower is at (x=800, y=900). Head
into the northern tower, first. Cast Remove Fear before you do, however-
you know, just in case.

North-Eastern Tower (AR9706)
o======================================================================o
9) In this tower you'll find the Harpy Queen. I wonder how Harpies
reproduce? No, no, I don't. Anyways, she'll talk at you, but a fight is
inevitable. My strategy here is quite simple-all five of my Clerics cast
Symbols of Hopelessness in the middle of the room. Once out, I ignore
the affected Harpies and run up to the Harpy Queen. If she's affected-
great. If not-she's my target anyways. She knows a variety of Mage
spells (up to 5th level, in fact) and will not hesistate to use them.
Typically she employs Stoneskin, but she's not above throwing out a
Dispel Magic to ruin your Symbols of Hopelessness (and spell buffs).
Also, her spells are really the most direct threat to us in any
difficulty. Once she's down, it's really just a matter of mopping up
any Harpies unaffected by the Symbols, then slaughtering the ones that
were. Once the birds are plucked, loot the Harpy Queen for Chautog's
Thinker*1, a Ring of Greater Resistance, and three Potions of Extra
Healing. Before leaving, activate the lever at (x=270, y=430).

*1: A fairly interesting helmet, actually. It gives a +1 bonus to
Armor Class, a +1 bonus to Intelligence, and imposes a useless -2
penalty to Charisma. It's not the Blessed Helm of Lathander, but it is
an alternative to the Dead Man's Face. Since I have nowhere near enough
good helmets for everybody, it'll find itself a home. Also, since it's
a moderately useful item that increases Intelligence, I keep it handy
for when I need to scribe those 19th 2nd-and-4th-level spells.

South-Eastern Tower (AR9708)
o======================================================================o
10) Now it's time to explore the south-eastern tower. Again, we might
just find things within that aren't friendly, so rest up if you're
injured. Don't bother spell-buffing, however. Head inside and you'll
be pestered by one Criek of Bane. Again, the conversation is
inconsequential, since it'll result in a fight anyways. Criek is a
Cleric, joined by a Djinni, Shelhai, a Fighter with a weapon that can
stun you, and Adaran Runeshadow-a Mage. The first thing Criek will
ALWAYS do is cast Dispel Magic. You cannot stop him-or at least, I've
never been able to. So, avoid the buffing, and just take the Dispel
Magic from him. Once it's cast, I respond with five Symbols of
Hopelessness from my Clerics, and Chaos from Syrenil. Once you're done
schooling them in matters of magic, cut down any and all foes who aren't
affected (if any), then massacre the ones who are. Flip the lever at
(x=270, y=440) and loot the dead for a wonderful haul of loot:

Criek of Bane: Ring of Greater Resistance, Fire Flail +3*1, Bag of
	       Holding*2, 231 gold.

Djinni: Wind of Heaven*3.

Shelhai: Full Plate Mail +1, Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Fire Opal Ring,
	 Ring of Free Action, King's Tears, Charged Battle Axe +2,
	 800 gold.

Adaran Runeshadow: Robe of the Evil Archmagi, Golden Girdle, Boots of
		   Grounding*4, Cloak of Scintillating Colors*5, Ring
		   of Fire Resistance*6, Ring of Protection +2, The
		   Genie's Flask, Wand of Fire, Staff of the Hanged
		   Men's Glee*7, 1230 gold.

***TRAPS***
(x=440, y=660)

*1: We could have found one of these earlier, if Joril was being nice.
Chances are, however, he wasn't. This is a guaranteed drop of the best
Troll-killer my Clerics can get their hands on.
  ---
*2: Another Bag of Holding! Score! This one comes with some loot inside-
as follows: Potion of Holy Transference, Potion of Invulnerability,
Mummy's Tea x4, Philter of Purification x2, Wand of Fear, Antidote,
Scroll of Neutralize Poison, Scroll of Raise Dead, Scroll of Symbol of
Pain, Potion of Regeneration, Potion of Explosions, Flaiming Oil x4.
  ---
*3: The best Scimitar in the game, Druids rejoice! This is a +4 weapon,
which acts as a +5 versus Elementals. It also makes the wielder immune
to Cloudkill, Death Fog, Stinking Cloud, Cloud of Pestilence, and
Malavon's Corrosive Fog.
  ---
*4: The next best cloak in the game... after Wailing of Virgins. It
gives a brute +3 bonus to Armor Class and can be worn with any other
form of magical protections. But, let's go for a direct comparison-there
are four Armor Class categories-crushing, missile, piercing, and
slashing. This cloak gives +3 to them all. Wailing of Virgins gives +4,
+4, +4, and +2. Crunch the numbers and Scintillating Cloak give +12
amongst all the Armor Class types, whereas Wailing of Virgins
gives +14. Also, it protects against fear and Hopelessness, making it
the clear winner. If only the Scintillating Cloak added to saves, I
would marry it...
  ---
*5: Boots that give +50% resistance to electricity, a rather rare form
of attack. Everard had a pair of these, but it wasn't worth killing him
to get them, and these aren't worth wearing, really.
  ---
*6: A humble ring that gives +40% Fire Resistance. There are a number of
foes who use fire in the game, and although they're not a prevelent as
cold-using foes, it's still nice to have rings like this around. Once
my triple-classers gain more levels, they really won't need Kontik's
Ring of Wizardry or Rings of Holiness anymore, which will make keeping
this ring equipped at all times a interesting idea... that or the Ring
of the Warrior.
  ---
*7: Given all the other great loot I had found on these guys, I was
looking at this unidentified staff thinking... Staff of Power!... no
such luck, it's a simple +1 Quarter Staff that allows you to cast

Castle Maluradek, Western Walls (AR9709)
o======================================================================o
11) Two levers flipped, now it's time to head back out onto the wall
(x=350, y=300), and down the stairs to the courtyard (x=400, y=800).
Make your way to the western part of the level (your odds of fighting
Wyverns and/or Harpies along the way? Pretty high.) and up some stairs
(x=650, y=1100) to reach the western wall. There are some Wyverns up
here, near the southern tower. Dispose of them, then note the two
towers-the southern tower (x=770, y=1000) and the northern tower
(x=100, y=100).

South-Western Tower (AR9702)
o======================================================================o
12) I choose to explore the southern tower first this time.. why?
Because thar's fightin' to be dun! This tower is full of Wyverns led by
a Wyvern Matron. There was a Harpy Queen, why not a Wyvern Matron? A
series of Symbols of Hopelessness can finish this fight before it really
ever starts. Since it's a straight melee fight, it's the easiest fight
we've.. uh.. fought. Kill the critters and flip the lever at
(x=570, y=320)... but behold, we're not done yet. Stairs await at
(x=300, y=500). Possibly because of the levers we flipped earlier? Yeah,
that's right, we're going to have to backtrack to the east when we're
done here.. but there was no avoiding it. Anyways, head downstairs.

South-Western Tower Test (AR9701)
o======================================================================o
13 From where you arrive, head to the north to find the Luremaster
(x=600, y=200). Talk to him and he'll ask you a riddle, which is so
simple ever *I* figured it out:

"Of the elements I am born,
 My gift brings both love and scorn.
 My touch can feel either hot or cold,
 Yet I am not meant for a man to hold."

Answer: Wind

Answer correctly and you'll recieve 'The Tale of Sir Giles'*1, which..
just seems like one of those questy items you should hold on to, right?
You'll also get a pretty nice experience reward.

***REWARD***
(For answering the Luremaster's riddle correctly)
EXP	120000

*1: You should probably read this, as it details the feats of Sir Giles
against the dragon Aehirglass. This is kind of important information,
as in, the entire backstory to this place is built on it. Note that Sir
Giles fought with a Mace, and Lord Maluradek was a sissy.

North-Western Tower (AR9704)
o======================================================================o
14) Head back out onto the western wall and up into the northern tower.
Inside you'll find Harald wandering about. Before bothering with him,
grab the loot on the ground (x=440, y=450), which just happens to be a
'Holy Symbol of Helm'*1-another questy-seeming item. Harald isn't
terribly interesting, and if you talk to him he'll tell you about his
fall from grace when he and his buddies came here for glory and loot...
or was it when he proved to be a coward? Either way, he wants you to
kill him, since life sucks now. You don't actually have to kill him-and
doing so costs you reputation. On the other hand, he's got some rather
exquisite loot... if you kill him you'll score some Mithral Field Plate
Armor +2, a Golden Girdle, Boots of Grounding*1, Gauntlets of Weapon
Expertise*2, a Ring of Free Action, a Morning Star +4: Defender and
91 gold. Do what you will-he's not part of any quest or anything. Once
you're done, flip the lever at (x=300, y=500), then head down the stairs
at (x=580, y=320).

*1: Yes, it is indeed a quest item. Keep it.
  ---
*2: These pass Amirule over, since she's still using the Gauntlets of
Elven Might/Girdle of Stromnos combo (and will for the rest of this
playthrough), and find themselves in the possession of Kaelinalia.
Lucky girl.
  ---
*3: Again, Kaelinalia ends up with this one. Amirule already got one
when we killed Quinn in Lonelywood. Funny, how two of these awesome
weapons have required us to shed innocent blood. Oh well.

North-Western Tower Test (AR9703)
o======================================================================o
15) Here you'll find the Luremaster skulking in the corner again at
(x=600, y=200). No stupid riddles this time-he's more direct now. To
prove you're worthy heroes, you'll have to prove yourself in the
crucible of combat. He'll summon some Animated Plate to attack you.
Put them down and the Luremaster will reward you with 'The Tale of Sir
Erris'*1, and another quest reward. Joy. You can loot the vanquished
Animated Plates for Plate Mail Armor +1 and a variety of +1 weapons.
Now to leave the tower, return to the courtyard, and head to the eastern
wall.

***REWARD***
(For proving yourself in the crucible of combat)
EXP	120000

*1: The thing to note here is that Sir Erris fought with a 'mighty axe'.

South-Eastern Tower Test (AR9707)
o======================================================================o
16) Return to the southern tower on the eastern wall, where we fought
Criek and company. Wonder of wonders, there are now stairs accessible
at (x=660, y=330). Down here you'll find the Luremaster at
(x=480, y=340). Talk to him and you'll be rewarded with another damn
combat trial. Endurance is now the name of the game, and you'll have
to fight a number of plant-critters-Red Myconids, Mustard Jellies, and
a Shambler. Shamblers really, really suck-they've got tons of Hit
Points and they're immune to bludgeoning damage, effectively making
my Clerics incapable of harming them in melee. They take full damage
from acid and cold, which means using Vitrolic Sphere, Melf's Acid
Arrow, or Otiluke's Freezing Sphere isn't a bad idea. Best of all, they
take double damage (+128% actually) from electricity, but there just
aren't really any good single-target or party-friendly electric spells.
Syrenil can also hurt them with Lover or arrows, against which it
generously only resists half damage. The best option we have against
them is to just use death magic-I've found that Finger of Death works
well enough, and it'll do even better when employed en masse, after the
Shambler is perhaps weakened with Greater Malison. Once everything is
dead, the Luremaster shows up again and rewards you with experience and
'The Tale of Sir Zierkki'*1. Yay. Now leave this tower and explore the
northern tower-the former abode of the Harpy Queen.

***HoF***
Using death spells is just not an option in Heart of Fury mode-due to
the absurdly boosted Saves foes have. Yeah, you can still use
debilitators, but not death spells. Whatever. The best tactic for Heart
of Fury mode? I just use multiple Shocking Grasp spells to take them
down. It takes about eight to kill one Shambler, dealing about 60 damage
per spell.

***REWARD***
(For persevering against plants)
EXP	120000

*1: Again, the thing to note here is the weapon. This time it's a spear.

North-Eastern Tower Test (AR9705)
o======================================================================o
17) Go down the stairs at (x=700, y=350) and you'll be harassed by the
Luremaster. No combat or riddles this time-here it's a guessing game.
Pick the right chest or get hurt. You can't disarm the traps on the
chest (indeed, trying will only result in pain), so you'll just have to
guess. Oh, if only you had a way to know which chest was the right
chest! Eh.. you know, I'm kind of tired right now, and can't really
think of any funny follow-ups. Loot the chest at (x=370, y=600) to find
'The Tale of Sir Geddian'*1. No quest reward here, but at least we're
done in these stupid towers.

***ITEMS***
(x=370, y=600) The Tale of Sir Geddian

***TRAPS***

*1: The weapon this time is a sword.

Temple of Helm (AR9713)
o======================================================================o
18) Return to the courtyard and enter the building under the stairs that
lead to the eastern wall (x=1750, y=550). Inside you'll find a number of
Sword Spiders and Phase Spiders. Kill them and loot the books on the
altar at (x=640, y=260) to find the 'Manuscript of the High Watcher',
which provides more backstory detailing the fall of Castle Maluradek.
Yeah, it's all enthralling stuff. Activate the dish on the altar
(x=620, y=240) and put the Holy Symbol of Helm we found earlier in it.
The symbol of Helm will appear on the wall behind you, and stairs will
open up under the altar. Well, since we have no other options, let's
explore under the chapel! Exit this area at (x=600, y=290).

Catacombs (AR9714)
o======================================================================o
1) Behold! Catacombs. This place looks more like a Planescape: Torment
level than anywhere else in the game. Also, it's full of undead. Fun.
Traps and secret doors abound, so this is one of those levels that gives
FAQ-writers headaches. Following me closely will keep you from getting
fouled by traps and ambushes (there's a particularly obnoxious type of
undead in this level that will wreck havoc on you, strategically), and
it'll also keep you from walking around this level like an asshole,
looking for secret doors you missed-which is what I had to do the first
time I played this expansion. Anyways, head east, disarm and loot a
sarcophagus, and then head north.

***ITEMS***
(x=700, y=1850) Broken Armor, Broken Shield, Heavy Crossbow of Accuracy,
		Bolts +2 x20
(x=850, y=1720) Sunstone Gem x2
(x=850, y=1670) 87 gold

***TRAPS***
(x=700, y=1850)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) The first of our secret doors lie in this room-one on the northern
wall (x=330, y=1500) and one on the eastern wall (x=660, y=1500). Go
north first, dispatch a Boneguard Skeleton, and loot some coffers. Once
done, backtrack and explore beyond the eastern secret door. You'll find
some new foes, which are worth describing in detail:

Revenants
Revenants are undead critters that seem to be rather glitchy. Most of
the time you can just walk up and kill then conventionally... you know,
you click, your characters hack away, they die, yellow experience comes
up on the dialogue box-the usual. Occassionally, however, they'll play
possum like Trolls and just refuse to die-save that there is no
elemental solution-they're just immune to all damage while they're down
like this. I smell a bug, since most Revenants will simply die like
normal critters. If one refuses to stay dead, just leave the area
save/load, and try to kill it again... or, if your party is pro like
mine, just head out of sight, save the game, and try to nail them with
a Finger of Death. Repeat until they die. But wait, you say, a
Revenant isn't a living creature... how can Finger of Death work on it?
Ah... my child, remember those Ghasts and Ghouls in Upper Dorn's Deep
that counted as as MONSTER instead of as an UNDEAD? Yep, same thing
here. All Revenenants are technically monsters, hence-Invisosmite
doesn't work, but mind-affecting effects will.

Crypt Things
The other foe in this place is arguably far, far worse than Revenants,
as they makes navigating this level absolute hell. Crypt Things are
very weak combatants that have only one trick up their sleeve-they can
teleport your party members to various parts of the level. The issues
with this are obvious-a single character is much less likely to be able
to fend off whatever lies waiting for them than a party is. If you have
a more conventional party, having your party Mage teleported away is...
not healthy. Reuniting the seperated character(s) can be tricky as well,
considering that one group or another is likely to be vulnerable in
either magic or melee, or might lack trap detection... My two go-to
strategies are also a bust. Greater Invisibility will not prevent a
character from being targeted, and since they erroneously do not count
as undead, casting Invisibility and trying to use 'Turn Undead' on them
will not work, either. In fact, their teleport ability is not even
considered a magic attack (despite the fact that Teleport *IS* a spell
and it checks your Save vs. *SPELL*), so Magic Resistance and even
Antimagic Shell will not save you. On the plus side, since they are
wrongly considered to not be undead, they are susceptible to mind-
affecting spells. If you're willing to throw enough spells at them, you
can neutralize them with Symbols of Hopelessness. Also, since they are
not undead, Death Spell can prove extremely effective against them, as
they are not strong enough to be immune to it-one of the few times this
spell comes in handy. Just spot them with a hidden or invisible
character, and nail them with Death Spell. Sadly, they are too strong
for this to work in Heart of Fury Mode.

Despite focusing on these two foes, the level is actually quite a bit
more diverse. In the room to the east you'll find several Revenants,
Crypt Things, and  Skeleton Warriors. You'll also likely be bothered by
more Crypt Things from the room to the west, as well as our old friends,
Blast Skeletons. Kill whatever dares to oppose you, loot the Skeleton
Warriors for minor magical weapons, if you wish, and loot the
sarcophagus at (x=550, y=850) for a Copper Key*1. Yes, glitchy,
obnoxious undead (half of which aren't even really undead), traps, and
secret doors aren't enough-they needed to throw in specific keys, too.

***HoF***
Invisosmite returns with a vengeance! Unfortunately, Revenants and crypt
Things have the same issue that the Ghouls and Ghasts in Upper Dorn's
Deep had. They are not classified as UNDEAD-they are both apparently a
MONSTER. This means they can't be turned, so Invisosmite will not work
on them. It's still a useful tactic, however, as getting rid of as many
trash undead as possible will make it that much easier to kill Crypt
Things before they can deport your party members. A teleported character
in Heart of Fury mode can be in serious trouble. I suggest taking it
slow, scouting with an invisible or hidden character, and liberally
blasting any Crypt Things with pre-emptive spell-strikes to prevent them
from teleporting you. A little caution will go a long way. If you do
get teleported... well, this is another instance where having a party
full of Mages comes in handy-cast Invisibility and try to make your way
back to your party, or wait around for rescue, whichever is easier.

***ITEMS***
(x=350, y=1250) Scroll of Disintegrate
(x=350, y=1270) 47 gold
(x=350, y=1300) Moonbar Gem x3
(x=550, y=850) Copper Key

*1: Seems kinda questy. You should probably hold onto it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) Once you've put down the threats in this room, head through the door
to the west. If they didn't bother you earlier, you'll find a Crypt
Thing here, as well as several Blast Skeletons. Up to the north you'll
find some Boneguard Skeletons and another Crypt Thing. Dispose of them
and loot the sarcophagus at (x=400, y=450) to score a Silver Key.

***ITEMS***
(x=400, y=450) Silver Key*1

*1: You know the drill, hold onto this gaudy thing until we find out
where it goes.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Now it's time to explore to the south. Backtrack to the first room
we were in and go through the doorway to the south to find a room with
lootable coffers and a pair of secret doors-one to the south at
(x=950, y=2250), and one to the east at (x=1120, y=2020). Ignore the
secret door to the south for now, as it actually leads somewhere
productive and head east, instead.

***ITEMS***
(x=900, y=1950) 127 gold
(x=900, y=1970) Ring of Holiness*1
(x=600, y=2060) Static Darts +3
(x=600, y=2120) Boots of Avoidance*2

*1: Yet another one. I'm sure you can find a Cleric with a free finger
somewhere.
  ---
*2: These lovely boots were an absolute godsend in Baldur's Gate...
well, except unlike godsends, they actually exist... albeit on a video
game. Of course, creatures use ranged attacks much less frequently in
Icewind Dale, and we haven't seriously been threatened by missile
weapons since our first run through the Severed Hand. Put them on if
you have cold feet, but they're not terribly useful defensive items.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Beyond the first secret door to the east is a tiny chamber that
houses... yet another secret door (x=1300, y=1950). Beyond this second
door is a room full of undead-six Wights and a Crypt Thing. An invisible
character can Invisosmite most of them, then my party lobs a few mind-
affecting spells-Chaos/Symbol of Hopelessness-to deal with the Crypt
Thing. Once everything is dead, loot some coffers and find another secret
door to the east (x=1730, y=1830). Beyond it lies another group of
undead-two Skeleton Warriors, two Revenants, and a Crypt Thing. Deal
with them in the same fashion we dealt with the last room and you'll be
fine. Once your opposition lies defeated, note the locked door to the
north-east (x=1950, y=1550). Perhaps its locked state has something to
do with those keys we've been finding? Hmmm... But since our FAQ-writer
told us to come here without the key, that can only mean three things...
1) He's an idiot, 2) Opening that specific door doesn't matter right
now, or 3) We couldn't have obtained the key we need for it yet. It's
a mystery, folks!

***ITEMS***
(x=1500, y=1760) Girdle of Bluntness*1

*1: Like the Golden Girdle, except this belt grants you a +4 bonus to
Armor Class versus bludgeoning attacks. It's not a phenomonal item, and
I refuse to waste the time running through the list of monster items to
see how much slashing, bludgeoning, piercing, and missile weapons are
used to determine which of these mediocre girdles is actually better
than the other. If you have an empty belt slot, it's worth equipping,
but it's not to be compared with the Shimmering Sash.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Backtrack to the west a bit until you return to the room where we
smote the Wights and the Crypt Thing. There's a not-so-secret doorway to
the south we neglected earlier. Take your Thief, head inside, and Detect
Traps like crazy, as this room is absolutely full of them. As an aside,
it's one of the many locations where you could have been teleported by a
Crypt Thing, and appearing here without a Thief is just... suckful.
Anyways, disarm the copious collection of traps about, then pick up
the money in the middle of the room... like you still need money
anymore. All in all, you stand to score 4417 gold and a few gems...
Yay...

***ITEMS***
(x=1880, y=2270) 239 gold
(x=1900, y=2275) Sunstone Gem x3

(x=2050, y=2310)
(x=2050, y=2380)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Now, backtrack until you're back in the room just south-east the
first room in this area (the one with the two secret doors in Step #5),
and go through the secret door at (x=950, y=2250), beyond which you'll
find another Crypt Thing for your smiting pleasure. Beyond the secret
door you'll find a passage continuing to south-west, and yet another
secret door on the wall opposite the one we just went through at
(x=1350, y=2400). First, let's explore to the west, which terminates in
a room occupied by several Blast Skeletons lining the western, northern,
and southern walls, with a Crypt Thing in the north-eastern corner of
the room-making this room a prime target for Invisosmite. Once the
Blast Skeletons are done, either toss some spells at the Crypt Thing, or
rush it an hope for the best. Once done, marvel at the emptiness of the
room and head back to the secret door we ignored earlier.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) This door can be tricky, as beyond lie a host of undead, including
five Ghosts, two Boneguard Skeletons, and a Crypt Thing. One of the
ghosts in a squealin' little asswipe situated near the door, who will
immediately tip off his undead buddies unless you're all sophisticated-
like. What I do is simple-I move my party back into the room to the
north-east, open the door with Syrenil, then immediately use stealth.
With any luck I end up with one open door, and eight undead none the
wiser. Afterwards, deal with the undead beyond as you will.

***ITEMS***
(x=1200, y=2650) Electrum Key*1

*1: Another key. Yay. What the hell is Electrum? Well, if you are like
me and were weaned on Gold Box Dungeons and Dragons game, you'll know
Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver. Sounds pretty unappealing, to
me.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Another Step, another secret door. This one is at (x=1650, y=2650)
beyond which is a long corridor leading east. This corridor is lined
by Skeleton Warriors, who are no major threat anymore, but the Crypt
Things every so often are somewhat more concerning, especially the two
near the junction where the tunnel turns north-west. There's another
one where the tunnel shifts to the north. By my counts, there are
fourteen Skeleton Warriors and three Crypt Things, and... I know I sound
like a broken record, but Invisosmite clears this corridor out nicely.
After which, only the Crypt Things remain an issue. These ones are rare
in the fact that they-unlike most of their fellows-aren't smart enough
to keep their backs to the wall-which means Syrenil can go about
backstabbing them. With any luck you'll only have to save against one
Teleport attempt. In all honesty, this threat is becoming less and less
acute. The more we explore, the greater the chance that we'll be
teleported into cleared territory. Also note that each Skeleton Warrior
drops a Long Sword +1-surely something we need not equip, but if you
still need money for some reason, you can put your Bag of Holding to
good use and hawk them in bulk to Hobart. Murder and plunder down the
corridor (or if that sounds too 'real' for you, you can just give it a
bullshit happy name-like 'Operation Corridor Freedom') until you reach
a dead end. Oh nos!

***HoF***
In Heart of Fury Mode, sneak attacks with Syrenil are not advised-there
is no chance you'll deal enough damage to kill a Crypt Thing in one hit.
So... debilitators are the order of the day. Just something to keep in
mind-every time you can get away with a one-hit-kill backstab in lesser
difficulties-it's not the suggested tactic for Heart of Fury.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Fortunately, it's yet another secret door (=x3600, y=1800), beyond
which lies another, somewhat wider, corridor. Instead of undead,
however, we're rejoined by our old friend Mister Trappy. Hello Mister
Trappy! What's that? No, I'm not putting my foot on that pressure plate,
no matter how much you smile at me with your sharp, rusty, metal teeth.
Ah, that Mister Trappy, he's such a kidder...

<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) After you've disarmed every trap in the free world on your way
north, there's only one way to go from here-to the south-west. In that
direction you'll find a junction room of sorts, which splits off to the
north-west, south-east, and back the way you came, of course. It's not
unoccupied, however-you'll need to dispatch two Crypt Things and four
Revenants before proceeding. Additionally there are a few Boneguard
Skeletons in the room to the south-east that may feel compelled to get
involved, if you're unlucky. Since Invisosmite is no good here, I just
sneak in with Syrenil, sneak attack one of the Crypt Things, then
hopefully save against the other's teleport and retreat, re-hiding and
dispatching the second Crypt Thing, if I'm lucky. Or I could just throw
in a Death Spell, if I'm feeling frisky. Either way, once the Crypt
Things are dealt with, lure the Revenants to the west and kill them
there-which should prevent any reinforcements coming up from the south.
If any of the Revenants are peskily clinging to life, resolve the issue
with Finger of Death. I point, you die. Love that spell.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Once the foes in the three-way junction room are destroyed, regroup
your party in the corridor to the north-east of the junction room.
Rushing in is still not a great idea, since there are plenty of undead
in the room to the south-east of the junction room that are just
itching to cause us trouble. The room to the south-east of the junction
room is a smallish room with several Boneguard Skeletons lurking in
alcoves, which aren't of much concern. What is more concerning,
however, are the forces in the room south-west of it, which include a
Greater Mummy, two Skeleton Warriors, and six Mummies... we'll
affectionately call it the 'Mummy Room'. Yeah, I'm creative like that.
North-west of the Mummy room is another densely-crowded room full of
baddies, including four Wights, two Boneguard Skeletons, two Revenants,
and a brutal three Crypt Things, all within easy sight of each other.
See how rushing into the south-eastern room could lure foes from the
Mummy room to the fight, which in turn could lure even more foes from
the north-western room? Yeah, we don't need to engage a Greater Mummy
and three Crypt Things-it could unneccessarily complicate things. My
tactics for clearing all three rooms should be obvious by now-use the
almighty Invisosmite tactic if you've got a high-enough level Cleric at
your disposal. If not, send in whichever character draws the short
straw to lure foes to your party. These tactics should be sufficient to
deal with the Boneguard Skeletons in the first room and clear out the
Mummy room save the Greater Mummy. Once the first two rooms are cleared,
rush the Greater Mummy with your party, eradicate him, and occupy the
Mummy room. If you are for whatever reason incapable of using
Invisosmite, settle for luring, but you'll likely have to endure
spells hurled by the Greater Mummy. In this case, leading with a
summoned creature will work to absorb some spells. When it falls the
Greater Mummy will drop a Wand of Trap Detection*1.

Note: Just to mention a few peculiarities about these rooms that I've
noticed... first, sometimes the Wights in the Crypt Thing room will
become mobile. I'm not sure why, but these foes are all aware of each
other, and if you end up engaging a Wight in combat, you can bet that
his buddies won't be far behind. The best way to safely Invisosmite
them is to block the door connecting their room to the Mummy room with
an invisible Cleric-this will allow you to take out a few of the Wights
before moving on. Also, note that the Greater Mummy will see through
your invisibility. He won't spoil your plans by attacking physically or
alerting his allies, but he will throw spells at you, making this a
potentially risky Invisosmite... unless you're able to turn him, of
course.

*1: Another one, wonder of wonders. This wand allows you to cast the
2nd-level Cleric spell 'Find Traps'... but it can only be used by a
Mage. Oookay... We already know why that spell is useless, right? Add
to that the fact that this wand has only eight charges and... well, it's
only so much kindling.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) In room north-west of the Mummy room, things work differently. Since
the most annoying foes within don't count as undead, Invisosmite is of
limited use (although still a fine way to clear out the Wights and
Boneguard Skeletons). I launch a vicious spell-assault into the room
without bringing anything into sight-no use holding back, the less Crypt
Things running about, the better. Once my massive one-round bombardment
of status-affecting spells is over, I rush in and kill whatever is left.
Once done, loot the Sarcophagus in the Mummy room and junction room for
more keys.

***ITEMS***
(x=2930, y=1400) Platinum Key*1
(x=2700, y=2200) Gold Key*2

*1: Another key, another quest item reminder.
  ---
*2: It's goooold, baby. I feel like I've used that line in another FAQ
recently... oh well, keep it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
14) Now that we've cleared out these rooms, we've only got one way to
go... Well, two, really, but since they both lead to the same place...
I'll take the pressure off myself and give you some options. There are
two doors, one in the Crypt Thing room (x=2250, y=1550) and one in the
junction room (x=2400, y=1370). The former opens with the Copper Key,
while the latter opens with the Silver Key, which will disappear when
you open their corresponding door. Open one (or both) of the doors, but
do not rush on in, as the room is positively crawling with Crypt Things.
Six of them, in fact. Blast the room liberally with spells before
entering and hope for the best. A single Death Spell can go a long way
here.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
15) Occupy the circular chamber you just cleared and note that you're
now in the center of the map. Also note the doors around here-they
all take specific keys to open... but we'll get back to this shortly.
Before we worry about any of these doors, there's an passage to the
west we can explore. The room beyond is occupied by four Blast
Skeletons, four Boneguard Skeletons, two Revenants, and a Crypt Thing.
If you can Invisosmite, go for that to thin the herd, after which the
Crypt Thing can be dispatched with a backstab, leaving only two
Revenants to put down-easy as pie. Once they're dead, notice that if
you continue to the south-west you'll reach the beginning of the crypts.
Huzzah! We've come full circle! Yeah, there was a reason I didn't
clear this room immediately... it would have just led to the central
circular room, where we wouldn't have had many keys at our disposal.
Worse than just being a waste of time, however, fighting six Crypt
Things at that point in time would have been a huge pain in the ass-
since nearly every place they could have teleported us would be in
dangerous, unexplored territory.

***ITEMS***
(x=1100, y=1610) Scroll of Domination
(x=1100, y=1590) Morning Star of Lesser Phasing*1
(x=1100, y=1560) Water Opal
(x=1450, y=1470) Bullet +2 x20
(x=1450, y=1450) Pearl Necklace

*1: Yeah, has this ever been a good weapon? I remember passing one of
these up way back in the Severed Hand, surely it can't compete with
whatever weapons we've obtained in the meantime.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
16) Backtrack to the central room-we'll be returning here quite a bit
for the rest of the level, as you can well imagine. There are several
doors as of yet unopened; (x=1720, y=1250) requires the Platinum Key,
(x=1880, y=1100) requires the Gold Key, and (x=2150, y=1100) requires
the Electrum Key, which we have, as well as the door at (x=1950, y-1550)
which requires the Bronze Key, which we do not have. To proceed to the
conclusion of this area, we must open all the door, no matter how
pointless the area behind them is. My suggestion? Let's just explore
this area clock-wise, starting with the Platinum Key door.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
17) Beyond the Platinum Key door (which you should open carefully, to
avoid alerting the foes beyond, if possible) you'll find two Crypt
Things, four Ghosts, and a Revenant. It's not a challenging fight
anymore-Crypt Things have by now lost almost all their potency, so
I'll leave the messy details up to you. Loot a sarcophagus and find an
old friend of ours, which we haven't seen a while-a secret door
(x=1250, y=1000).

***ITEMS***
(x=1020, y=1200) Studded Leather Armor of Resistance +3*1,
		 Reinforced Large Shield +2*2,
		 Shocking Flail +4*3

***TRAPS***
(x=1020, y=1200)

*1: Decent armor, but nowhere near up to snuff anymore.
  ---
*2: One of the best shields in the game... the main game, at least.
The many great expansion shields out-compete this shield. I can't
find a home for it on my party.
  ---
*3: What a generous sarcophagus! This is probably the best item that
comes out of it-a +4 Flail that gives a +1 bonus to Armor Class, has a
50% chance of dealing 2d3 electrical damage, and a 10% chance of
stunning the target. Seriously not bad. Of course, by now we could have
found three Morning Star +4: Defenders, which are superior. Also,
elecricity is a lack-luster element, as it won't put down Trolls, so
it's not a replacement for the Fire Flail +3, either. Still, it's
superior to the Fist of the Gloomfrost.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
18) Go through the secret door to find another small, relatively lightly
defended room, guarded by a trio of Boneguard Skeletons and a Crypt
Thing. Not a hard fight, you don't need me to insult you by telling you
how to kill them. Once they're dead, loot the coffers and behold-another
secret door (x=900, y=550)! Beyond another secret door-another room full
of monsters. This time you'll find a Boneguard Skeleton, three Wights,
and two Crypt Things-nothing to get worked up over. Once this room is
sacked (there's nothing in it of interest) return to the circular
central room.

***ITEMS***
(x=1000, y=910) Static Darts +3 x20
(x=900, y=770) Bastard Sword +3: Incinerator*1
(x=900, y=750) 14 gold
(x=800, y=630) 230 gold
(x=770, y=620) Sphene Gem

*1: A very fine Bastard Sword, indeed-this is a +3 weapon that has a 50%
chance of dealing +1d8 fire damage, and a 10% chance of stunning foes.
Very nice, indeed.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
19) Now to explore beyond the Gold Key door. You need not fear monsters
here-but there are a few traps that need to be disarmed before you
investigate the secret doors along the northern wall (x=1440, y=800),
(x=1650, y=700). The western door opens to a small chamber occupied by
a trio of Revenants. The eastern-and more interesting-door opens to a
room full of Ochre Jellies, with a token Boneguard Skeleton to represent
the undead in the level. Smite the foes in both rooms and note yet
another secret door in the eastern room (x=1900, y=550), beyond which is
an insignificant room with several Ghosts inside. Try to stay awake as
you kill them, then return to the circular central chamber.

***TRAPS***
(x=1700, y=930)
(x=1520, y=870)
(x=1720, y=800)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
20) Two down, two to go, only one key left... well, let's hope this
door actually leads somewhere, eh? Beyond the door is a short tunnel
which terminates in a room occupied by three Ghosts, two Crypt Things,
and a Boneguard Skeleton. I'm sure you'll devise some masterful
strategy and inflict a crippling defeat upon them. Once you're done
writing your memoirs and celebrating your triumph (remember, you are not
a god), be surprised at the existence of yet another secret door
(x=2700, y=650). Surpise, dammit!
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
21) In this room await three Crypt Things and four Revenants-not a
single undead in sight. Adjust accordingly-tossing in a few debilitative
spells can go a long way towards reducing these foes... or a well-placed
Death Spell. Once they're wrecked, loot a sarcophagus in the middle of
the room for Bronze Key. Huzzah! It was a real nail-biter wondering if
we'd find this key or not, since I haven't been paying attention. Before
we go, however, there's another damn secret door to the north at
(x=2950, y=420). Fortunately, it's empty.

***ITEMS***
(x=3100, y=500) Bronze Key*1

*1: Bronze-the metal of the ancient Greeks... Keep it, of course.
We'll be using it soon.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
22) Head back to the central circular room, where you can open the final
locked door to the south-west. Once this final door has been unlocked a
passage will open to the north-east. Yes, you need to arbitrarily use up
every key and open up every door to continue on. Silly, isn't it? In
the room we just opened you'll find five Skeleton Warriors, two
Revenants, and three Crypt Things... destroy them, and carry on through
a door at (x=2900, y=1000).
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
23) Beyond this last, silly little door you'll find a room barren of all
life-and unlife for that matter-occupied by only four sarcophagi. This
is where the game makes sure you've been paying attention, as each of
these tombs belongs to one of the four heroic knights who accompanied
cowardly Lord Maluradek on their ill-fated crusade against the wyrm
Aehirglass... remember those four scrolls we got during the tower tests
earlier? Yeah, they talk about this fight, and a little bit of knowledge
will be required to proceed. But first, let's loot the sarcophagi:

***ITEMS***
(x=3400, y=700) Long Sword of Action +4*1, Reinforced Large Shield +2*2
(x=3500, y=850) Spear +1
(x=3000, y=850) Two Handed Axe +2: Life Giver*3
(x=3150, y=1000) Mace +1

Wow. These knights were certainly not all created equal, eh? In each
tomb are some arms each knight wielded in combat with Aehirglass... or
at least, there were until we sniped them. What you're supposed to do is
put the right tale scroll in the right sarcophagus, based on what
weapons were within. Simple, right? Even simpler still, you can just
guess, because when you put the right poem in the right tomb, the scroll
will vanish and the spectral knight indicated by the poem will appear,
thank you, and head off to enjoy their afterlife. So, let's deploy the
poems, as follows:

(x=3400, y=700) The Tale of Sir Geddian
(x=3500, y=850) The Tale of Sir Zierkki
(x=3000, y=850) The Tale of Sir Erris
(x=3150, y=1000) The Tale of Sir Giles

Once the final shade has come and gone, you'll get a whopping experience
reward. Plus, you get to keep all their loot. Score! Best of all, we're
done with this stupid crypt. Exit back to the surface (x=100, y=2100).

***REWARD***
(For putting the shades of Aehirglass' slayers to rest)
EXP	420000

*1: Another copy of perhaps the best sword in the game... I might not
go so far to say it's the best weapon in the game (I'd put the Long
Bow +4: Hammer and Morning Star +4: Defender is the upper echelon of
badassness this weapon enjoys), but it's still pretty nice. Of course,
my party can't make use of another one. Shame.
  ---
*2: Sir Geddian was a well-equipped guy, wasn't he? Unfortunately, like
the Long Sword of Action +4 above, I just don't have a use for this
shield... not because of class limitations, but because it's simply
out-matched.
  ---
*3: A +2 Two Handed Axe that has a 10% chance to heal the wielder for
2d3 points. If you've made it this far into the game where this is
possibly an upgrade for you, I just have one question... how? We were
finding better stuff than this in Dragon's Eye, way back in Chapter 2.

Hobart's Shack (AR9715)
o======================================================================o
1) First things first, we'd be silly to enter a keep potentially full of
loot without selling off some of our old stuff first, right? Sure we
would. So let's pay Hobart a visit to sell off our righteously-acquired
junk. No grave-robbing here, nosiree. When you talk to your shifty
little Gnome buddy, however, he'll let slip the ominous statement that
the Luremaster was 'right about you'. Interrogate him and he'll reveal
that he's been working for the Luremaster for decades now. Long story
short-he's a wussy, and the Luremaster employed him-with a teleporting
slave ring-to find REAL heroes to test out Castle Maluradek. So, yeah,
Hobart tricked you into coming here and has no way for you-or himself-
to get out, save by completing the Luremaster's challenges. Eh, we can
just export out, little man... but let's ignore silly game mechanics for
the sake of story, shall we? Be sure to sell off all the crap you don't
need/want, and buy as much ammunition as you need... you know, just in
case for some reason you can't come back.

Castle Maluradek, Downstairs (AR9711)
o======================================================================o
2) Once you're done shopping, leave Hobart's and head north into Castle
Maluradek (x=800, y=300). We're the first adventurers to ever make it
this far, according to Hobart, so let's make a good impression, eh? As
soon as we step inside, the Luremaster will bug us, and impart another
stupid riddle before leaving:

"To understand this shameful tale,
Through princely guards you must prevail.
'Neath unused arms and unstruck mail,
Will you find the coffin's nail.

'Round and 'round the sun does fly,
And one man left below will die.
His crime? To make the peasant's eye
Reflect his lord's ignoble lie."

Man, I don't credit myself with being very smart (that's a lie, I'm a
genius and everbody knows it)... okay, so I can't fake humility, but I
tend to suck at puzzles. This one, however is a no brainer. Kill some
guards, and find the 'nail'-the reason all this happened. If you read
those stupid poems earlier you'll know that Lord Maluradek is an
inglorious coward who fled from the dragon Aehirglass, while his knights
died fighting it. 'Neath unused arms and unstruck mail', indeed. Of
course, he sniped the dragon's loot and covered up his cowardice, which
is what this is really all about-the perversion of history and stolen
glory. History isn't written by the losers, or the winners-it's
ultimately left up to the survivors to interperate. So, we're clearly
looking for Lord Maluradek.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
3) But what of the 'through princely guards you must prevail'? Well,
simple. Head north-east into a large chamber and you'll see various
ghostly dorks wandering about. Don't worry about the 'Spectral
Courtiers' wandering about-they have nothing to say to you, and will
admit so if you talk to them. Of more interest are the 'Spectral Guards'
lurking around-two guarding a door with a pentragram barrier, and
two pair guarding a set of stairs to the north-west and south-east. If
you go near them (say, try to go up the stairs) they'll turn hostile
and attack. We'll deal with them later-they work as convenient devices
for guide organization. We'll deal with all the areas of this level we
can access without provoking the guards, then come back to deal with
them. Don't worry, this won't be a lengthy endeavor, there's not much
to do before we challenge the gaurds. But do we shall!
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) First we'll note all the pretty doors lying around. The door at
(x=2020, y=1250) is locked and cannot be opened right now, but if you
look at the ruined room on the other side of the entry hallway we can
guess that a staircase lies beyond. Beyond two more doors at
(x=470, y=1100) and (x=250, y=600) you'll find a ghostly chef who has
nothing interesting to say. Well, that's two busts. Err... well, in
the south-western corner of the level you'll find two pools of water,
which spawn two Water Kin Elementals for you to kill. See, this Step
wasn't a complete waste of time.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
5) Now, before you casually sashay up to a guard and pick a fight, you
should know that these guys are pretty damn strong-each one is a
15th-level Fighter with 18 Strength, 16 Dexterity, and 18 Constitution.
In addition, they have have attained the rank of Mastery in Long Swords,
and come equipped with a Helmet of Charm Protection, a Long Sword of
Action +4, and Plate Mail Armor (none of which will drop, of course,
it's just a way for Black Isle to pad their stats and make them combat-
worthy). So keep in mind that each one will boast 120 Hit Points, a
negative Armor Class, multiple attacks per round, and a very low
THAC0... and that's on the normal difficulty! On Insane difficulty they
were able to hit a -15 Armor Class on a roll of 8, and reliably did over
20 damage per hit. So, how to deal with them? First, put your party near
the arch that separates the entry corridor from the chamber beyond-the
good old bottleneck is always a good strategy. Pound for pound, I'll put
my characters up against any two of them, and this ensures that's the
best odds they'll get. Second, don't be fooled by their numbers-more
will appear when you provoke the visible ones (numbers depending, of
course, on what difficulty you're on). Third, spell-buff. Moderate
spell-buffing is enough for normal mode-a Haste here, Protection From
Evil 10' Radius there, Righteous Wrath of the Faithful, maybe a
Stoneskin or two to stiffen a few characters defensively... the good
stuff. Finally, consider what type of creature they are-are they undead,
as they should be, or are they monsters? Undead, in this case, which
means no debilitative spells, but... well, if you've got a strong enough
Cleric, Invisosmite will work. Once you're ready, provoke the guards by
the pentagram-sealed door (I use a sneaking Syrenil to accomplish this),
and dispatch them when they come to the party. I counted eight Spectral
Guards in total.

Note: You can provoke another group of guards if you return to the
kitchen-the Spectral Cook will bitch at you and summon some guards.
This is an entirely unneccessary and unrewarding encounter, however.

***HoF***
In Heart of Fury Mode these undead are just too strong for Invisosmite-a
rare occurance, indeed. Even with a 30th-level Cleric, the best you can
do is turn them... which is something, but honestly, even this
impressive amount of melee might simply cannot compete with my uber
triple-class party spell-buffed to the max. I use same tactics as on
normal mode, but I simply spell-buff more.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) Once all the guards are slaughtered, creep out of the entry corridor.
Guess what's next? Yeah, more guards. There are plenty of the buggers
throughout the level, so far we've only dealt with one of three waves.
The next group I prefer to focus on while my buffs last are the ones by
the stairs to the west. Do not actually run your party up the stairs,
though-no need to give them a good bottleneck. Again, I call on Syrenil,
who sneaks up the stairs while the rest of my party waits out in the
open to kill the gaurds once they get tempermental. Once these guards
are dead, jog on over to the eastern stairs, but this time, run your
whole party up them quickly, then turn to confront the guards as they
follow you up the stiars. Yep, another bottleneck. I'll stop using it
when it stops working. Once these guards are all dead, take a breather.
It's time to explore the areas we've gained access to by conquest.

***HoF***
Do not feel compelled to keep pace with the normal mode playthrough-if
you're worried about your buffs running out, feel free to rest and
rebuff. Running out of buffs mid-fight is a good way to get slaughtered,
and it's just unnecessary, sloppy play.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Now that the guards are dead, take a look around-one little three
foot tall anomally should stick out like a sore thumb... Hobart stands
at (x=2180, y=230). Talk to him, and... it doesn't really matter what
you say. Or rather, I should say the only things you can say provoke a
fight-he wants you to find a key for him, you have no choice but to
refuse, and a fight ensues. Hobart will turn into a Rakshasa and attack.
Not by himself, mind you-he's got another Rakshasa buddy to the south,
and a third to the north-west. They'll also be joined by a small horde
of Invisible Stalkers, making this a messy encounter. Of course, like
most fights, sufficient spell-buffing beforehand can make this fight...
more or less a breeze. You may be tempted to gather your party near the
stairs so as to avoid being surrounded, but Rakshasa are the real
threats, and I find it preferable to split my party into three pairs-one
pair for each Rakshasa. Now, since Rakshasa are new foes, it might be
worthwhile to talk about the threat they pose First, they are all
11th-level Fighter/Mage/Clerics, so they've got the right idea when it
comes to power combinations. They're 50% resistant to all phyiscal
damage, and have a decent Armor Class, but they're still not warriors
of any real potency. They do have plenty of spells, however, including
plenty of offensive spells... they even have the Dispel Magic-the bane
of buffs-but they'll rarely cast it. Still, with some buffing you should
roll right over them, and the Invisible Stalkers are really just pests,
not true threats. Once they're dead, loot the Rakshasa for Cloaks of
Non-Detection and some gold. In case you're wondering, this was not the
real Hobart you just killed. Rakshasa are notoriously power-hungry
shapeshifters, so it makes sense they'd be lurking around here looking
for loot... although taking the form of Hobart and expecting a positive
response from us is just a sad misunderstanding on their part. At least
we can still trade with Hobart, however.

***ITEMS***
(x=1950, y=50) Scroll of Monster Summoning IV, Scroll of Flesh to Stone,
	       Scroll of Tenser's Transformation

***HOF***
The same tactics work for Heart of Fury mode as for the normal
difficulty-the Rakshasa are the most dire threats and each deserve
direct attention from two of my party members. A high-level party,
fully-equipped and fully-buffed are able to massacre these cats. The
clean up against the Invisible Stalkers is a bit tougher, however.
Simply rebuff Stoneskin and Heal as needed and you'll be fine.

Castle Maluradek, Upstairs (AR9712)
o======================================================================o
8) The false Hobart was eagerly looking for some key-'upstairs, possibly
within the bedchambers of the late lord'. Now that we were pointlessly
defiant, we might as well look for this key. If some stupid backwards-
palmed cat-man thought it was worth looking for... well, why not? The
stairs up are at (x=250, y=1400), so stroll on over there. Once upstairs
you'll have to dispatch a few Spectral Guards-you should know what to
expect when it comes to them by now.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) From the stairs head north, then go into a room to the east, where
you'll find two more Spectral Guards by a doorway along the eastern
side of the room. In adjacent rooms to the north and south are two
pools, each with two Water Kin Elementals dwelling within them. Given
that, it might be a better idea to lure the Spectral Guards to you,
then deal with the Water Kin Elementals separately. You know, just to
keep things simple.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
10) Once all your foes are crushed, continue to the east to enter a room
with a pipe ogran, within which you'll encounter a Beholder. Anybody who
has played Dungeons and Dragons should know what a Beholder is-a big orb
of eyes that can each cast nasty spells. They're nothing short of
floating orbs of magical mean-sauce, but the counter should be obvious,
right? Antimagic Shell, of course! Sadly, their magical, spell-spewing
eye-rays do not count as magical attacks for some reason, so no such
simple counter is possible. Also, their fondness for Dispel Magic makes
buffs vulnerable to dispersal... so, what to do? Well, buff up a bit
(focus on offensive buffs, like Haste and Righteous Wrath of the
Faithful) and just rush it. With any luck, our party should be able
to simply chop the beast down before anybody is struck with a death
spell. Yeah, it's inelegant, but it works... most of the time. In case
you're curious, the spells... I mean, not-spells they can cast are
Dispel Magic, Fear, Slow, Sleep, Cause Serious Wounds, Charm Person,
Disintegrate, Finger of Death and Flesh to Stone.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Well, that was fun. While we still have buffs in place and Beholders
on the brain, continue into a hallway to the east. The hallway will
shortly turn south and encircle some rooms-which you should ignore for
now and continue down the hallway to the south. As you explore the
hallways you'll run into another Beholder. Worse still, he'll be joined
by a buddyholder to the north. That's twice the evil spell-power, and
in Icewind Dale, there's just no good counter to it. Focus on one at
a time and try to keep a Haste in effect if at all possible. With any
luck (and I do mean luck) you'll be able to take them down before they
bypass your saves and cause any casualties.

***HOF***
I really don't see any difference in the difficulty in Heart of Fury
mode. Sure, Beholders have more Hit Points, but they're not any more
dangerous, comparatively. My characters are more potent in melee, and
they have lower saves, which compensates for the greater potency of the
Beholders. At the end of the day, the same tactics-as simple as they
are-will just have to work. Seriously, there is no magical work-around
to this-Antimagic Shell, Magic Resistance, or even Greater Shield of
Lathander won't protect you since their eye rays don't count as magical
attacks. You just need to rely on your saves-which is to say, luck, and
the faster you take them down, the less attacks they'll get off.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Now search the rooms we bypassed in order to harass the Beholders.
They're generally uninteresting-minor loot, with a few Spectral Guards
that need some death. Once you're done search the rooms, exit the
hallway formerly occupied by Beholders via its southern exit to reach
a small, completely uninteresting room. From here, you have two ways to
go-either continue south-west, or into a circular room to the south-
east. Do yourself a favor and loot the room to the south-east, as you'll
score some scrolls and a Tome of Leadership and Influence*1.

***ITEMS***
(x=1820, y=400) Scroll of Power Word: Stun
(x=2300, y=1400) Scroll of Acid Storm, Scroll of Power Word: Kill,
		 Scroll of Prismatic Spray
(x=2400, y=1400) Tome of Leadership and Influence

*1: Permanently increases the reader's Charisma by one-with no downsides
whatsoever. Charisma is a pretty useless attribute, really only
affecting the prices at stores, something that has long since been
moot. Still... it is a free stat boost, and my power-gamey self can't
help but be a little excited by it, even though I fully acknowledge its
uselessness.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) Enter the larger chamber to the south-west now, where you'll find
Lord Maluradek to the north-west (x=1400, y=1050). He'll babble about
you being a traitor, then boast about deeds he never performed before
finally turning hostile. You should know how this is going to go by now-
I'm going to read off some stats, then tell you to simply spell-buff and
everything will go fine. It's a well-worn system, and it works, so,
yeah, we'll keep at it. Why didn't I mention stats that often earlier
in the guide? Because weak monsters are boring. Anyways, here we go-
Lord Maluradek, despite being pegged as a weakling coward throughout the
entire expansion, he's actually fairly strong. Does this make any sense
whatsoever? Not a bit, but I digress... He's got 250 Hit Points, and
his THAC0 and Armor Class... well, they're only mediocre, roughly
comparable to the Spectral Guards we've been slaughtering. On the other
hand, he's 25% resistant to physical damage, and has 75% magic
resistance, is a 9th-level Fighter, 20th-level Mage, and 20th-level
Cleric. Don't ask how, that's just what the file says. Despite his
potential spell-power, he's a rather weak caster. He's got a fairly
limited spell arsenal consisting of the following spells-Animate Dead,
Detect Invisibility, Dispel Magic, Horror, Power Word: Blind, Power
Word: Kill, Power Word: Stun, Symbol of Pain, Symbol of Hopelessness.
He can also use the 'Teleport' not-spell that the Crypt Things used...
but he'll only send you to adjacent rooms. He's got unlimited spells,
and frankly, he prefers standing back casting spells... yeah, he thinks
he's some kind of debilitator/controller caster. Only problem-his
Teleport is an inconvenience, and with the Wailing of Virgins cloak,
you're immune to fear effects and Symbol of Hopelessness. Also, since
he won't use any damaging spells, his Power Words are useless. So...
he might be able to annoy you by teleporting you, and he might inflict
short-term blindness or pain, but he's really not capable of harming
my party leader. So... I engage him with only Ilnathias and dispatch him
shortly. When he falls, I loot him for his sword-the Dead God's
Dreaming*1.

***HOF***
He's not really any stronger in Heart of Fury mode-his Animate Dead
spell can summon some weak undead which-in Heart of Fury mode are at
least capable of dealing damage, which in turn could potentially lead
to a character taking enough damage for a Power Word to work. So... my
tactics are the same, save now my whole party can safely gang up on
Lord Maluradek, since they all have Waling of Virgins cloaks. If the
coward summons some undead, I just turn on my Turn Undead ability and
smite them. Lord Maluradek isn't a threat to even one of my characters,
much less my entire party.

*1: Fun name, but it's a crappy sword. This +4 Bastard Sword acts as a
+6 weapon versus good foes. Sadly, most foes in this game are... well,
not good, and a weapon that is merely +4 hasn't been impressive for a
long while. On the plus side, it can cast Emotion: Fear 3/day, and
Symbol of Pain 1/day. Still not nearly good enough to use... even if I
could use it. On the plus side, it sold for 52000 gold, which should
be more than enough to buy anything you could possible want from
Hobart.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
14) Well, Maluradek is dead. I'm sure somebody, somewhere, cares. Loot
the cabinet near the bed (x=1300, y=1000) to score 'Maluradek's
Journal'*1. Nothing you read within it will be surprising-greed,
cowardice, politics, a cover-up, paranoia, violence, and finally
madness. That old gem. Still, it's not a key, so let's keep looking,
shall we? Head into a room to the east and go through a secret door at
(x=1720, y=900), where you'll find some loot just... lying
unceremoniously on the ground at (x=1870, y=800). We have our key, now
to find our door... as for the rest of the level, west of where we
encounter Maluradek as little of interest, just two empty rooms which
you might have seen courtesy of Maluradek's Teleportation not-spell,
and a circular room to the south, beyond a locked door at
(x=1400, y=1700)... which houses nothing of interest.

***ITEMS***
(x=1870, y=800) High Quality Bastard Sword, Full Plate Mail +1,
		Dungeon Key*1, Great Shield +3*2

*1: We were looking for a key, weren't we? Yes, yes we were. Keep hold
    of this key if you want to proceed.
  ---
*2: This shield was... mediocre back in the Severed Hand, it's downright
    bad by now.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
15) As it turns out, the way forward lies behind us. Return to the
western side of the level and head back downstairs (x=400, y=1800), then
go through the locked door at (x=2050, y=1250), which we can now open
with the Dungeon Key. Beyond the door are stairs down (x=2450, y=1550).
It would be a good time to visit Hobart and sell off whatever loot you
don't plan to keep, buy whatever you need to keep going, and so on.
You know, just in case things get complicated.

Castle Maluradek, 1st-Level Dungeons (AR9716)
o======================================================================o
16) Go through a door at (x=1400, y=1200) to find... another door
(x=1150, y=1050) flanked by two levers (x=1080, y=1120),
(x=1290, y=1040). Despite what common sense might dictate, these two
levers have absolutely nothing to do with the door in front of you.
Instead, beyond the door lies a large chamber ringed by doors, beyond
which a number of monsters lurk. The eastern lever opens all the doors
on the eastern side of the room, and likewise with the west. If you
pull both levers, both sides will open and-providing the monsters
don't see your party-they will fight each other. If you try to simply
run for the exit on the north-western side of the chamber (x=500, y=200)
all the doors will open and you'll find yourself in a rather bad
situation. Lastly... an enterprising Thief can simply pick the locks on
the doors and you can tackle the rooms one at a time-which is probably
the easiest way to get through this... aside from simply running through
with an invisible party. I leave it to you to determine how you want to
get through this area-there's really nothing to be gained by fighting
save experience, however. Below are the doors that can be unlocked,
along with the creatures that lurk behind them. Once you're done, go
through the door at the north-western end of the large central chamber
(x=500, y=200).

(x=800, y=950) Minotaur x4
(x=620, y=700) Neo Orog Marauder x4
(x=400, y=450) Troll x4
(x=1250, y=800) Umber Hulk x4
(x=1050, y=550) Wyvern x4
(x=850, y=300) Red Myconid x4

Note: If you're looking at these creatures and thinking... "What's the
point? Didn't we fight these things back in Lower Dorn's Deep?" You've
got good reason to be indignant... mostly. Most of these creatures are,
in fact, exact copies of the weaklings we dispatched near the end of
the main game, and not really worthy of being fodder in a high-level
dungeon of an expansion. The exception to this rule are the Minotaurs.
The old Minotaurs and Blind Minotaurs we fought were both called...
'MINOTAUR'... in their CRE file-they had about 45 Hit Points, and really
weren't terribly exceptional foes. The ones here, however, have a
different CRE file, and hence, different stats. These ones are 'MINCAT',
and have 94 Hit Points, superior THAC0, Armor Class, Saves and attacks
per round, 18 Strength, 16 Dexterity, and 18 Constitution. Far, far
superior specimens. Still inferior to the Spectral Guards we've killed,
though, so chin up.

Castle Maluradek, 2nd-Level Dungeons (AR9717)
o======================================================================o
17) Before you go lurking around, cast Haste and Righteous Wrath of the
Faithful. Once buffed, head north and go through a door at
(x=2300, y=900), beyond which a Beholder lurks-a Beholder who would love
to get a jump on you if you let it. There are more Beholders beyond the
doors at (x=1900, y=1000), (x=2000, y=500) and (x=1590, y=700). They can
all be killed in one buffing if you're quick. It sucks having to fight
several of these things, considering that our tactics consist of nothing
more than an offensive rush and crossed fingers... but at least you only
have to fight them one at a time, eh?

***ITEMS***
(x=2230, y=950) Scroll of Monster Summoning VII
(x=1750, y=500) Animals Are Your Friend
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
18) North-west of the central chamber surrounded by the four Beholder
chambers is a magical door (x=1500, y=250), which will furnish you with
yet another tiresome riddle:

"Only those who have two heads with no eyes, a pair of mouths, but no
voice may pass beyond this door."

Oh yay, another riddle. This one, too, is a no-brainer. If you can't
figure it out... it doesn't matter, just know that we've got to search
this dungeon for the two 'heads' this stupid door wants. I suppose it
beats having to go through another useless level like the last one.
Back in the Beholder-bound room are two as of yet unexplored doors,
one to the north-east (x=2250, y=650) and one to the south-west
(x=1650, y=900). Who wants to bet that these objects we need for the
magic door lie at the end of some monster-filled tunnels beyond these
two doors? Of course they do. Let's start out with the northern door...
just because we have to start somewhere.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
19) Go through the door and you'll immediately be pestered by a pair of
Spectral Guards. Nothing special, smite them and continue on. Another
self-opening door at (x=2700, y=300) will unleash some Neo Orog
Marauders on you. Continue past the door and turn south. More doors
await, which will open as you approach and force you to dispatch more
monsters, as follows:

(x=3150, y=600) Minotaur x2
(x=3270, y=300) Umber Hulks x4
(x=3505, y=550) Wyvern x4

Go through another door to the south at (x=3450, y=750) and enter a
chamber occupied by a quartet of Spectral Guards. Once they're
dispatched, go through another door (x=3550, y=1100) to find a skeleton
(x=3460, y=1260) which will graciously provide a skull... one head,
two eyes, no voice. If only we had another one...

***ITEMS***
(x=3550, y=1100) Skull*1

*1: Yes, the answer to the riddle is a skull-the stupid door wants
two of them. This is one. Keep it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
20) Backtrack and head through the south-western door. Again you'll meet
two Spectral Guards, and beyond a door at (x=1200, y=1200) await four
Umber Hulks. I don't know about you, but this is becoming pretty
monotonous... More monster doors lie ahead:

(x=600, y=1300) Wyvern x4
(x=750, y=950) Neo Orog Marauder x4
(x=370, y=1000) Minotaur x4

Another door awaits to the north at (x=450, y=800), beyond which are
four more Spectral Guards. Exterminate them, then go through a locked
door at (x=350, y=450), loot another skeleton (x=370, y=250) for another
Skull. Return to the door and it'll anti-Gandalf at you before opening.
Score some experience, head down to the next level.

***ITEMS***
(x=350, y=450) Skull*1

***REWARD***
(For opening the magic door)
EXP	420000

*1: Ditto above.

Castle Maluradek, 3rd-Level Dungeons (AR9718)
o======================================================================o
21) You'll find yourself in an empty room. To the north-west is a gate
you can't open. Other than that, there's a lever at (x=1200, y=1100).
Not... not really many opens, eh? Considering casting a Mass
Invisibility spell on the party before you flip the lever as... it'll
make the next Step easier. Flip the lever and watch a cutscene.
Apparently this is where the Luremaster met his end, and he'll
challange you with yet another riddle:

"Your host was held unjustly while
The Lord so full of wrath and guild
Demanded that his bard should style
A tale to make his people smile.

Suffer not your host's cruel doom,
Use your time to flee this room.
Shadowed dogs lurk in the gloom,
And weave escape upon their loom.

If we chance to meet once more,
Your host will have a gift in store.
Defeat our shades in righteous war,
And we shall haunt this place no more."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
22) Another obvious 'riddle', he's challenging you to escape this place,
and so avoid ending up like him. Once he's done babbling, a host of
Olive Slimes will appear. They're not indestructable, but most parties
will not be prepared to handle them. Each Olive Slime has 58 Hit Points
and a paltry Armor Class, but they are immune to physical damage and
electricity. Only fire, cold and acid will harm them. Their Hit Points
are just high enough to make killing them with enchanted weapons a
tedious proposition, but for a party like mine, we can always just
handle them with massive spell power. For example, if we buffed ahead
of time with Minor Globe of Invulnerability, we could simply blast them
with Fireballs. But we didn't buff ahead of time, save Mass
Invisibility, something every party should be able to cast. Why? Because
there's just no point in fighting all these critters. But I wouldn't
be a very good FAQ-writer if I didn't at least talk about the area
you'll be bypassing. This place very much follows the rule of three-
there are three barrels to loot, three traps on the stonework in the
middle of the room, and three doors-although the two on the sides of
the room (x=300, y=1050) and (x=1200, y=600) just lead to rooms with
more enemies inside (including a Slime Zombie in each one, which isn't
nearly as troublesome as the Olive Slimes).

***HoF***
Don't even think about putting up a fight here, with their Heart of Fury
Hit Points, putting down these Olive Slimes with elemental damage is
just a chore. I don't know about you, but I hate chores!

***ITEMS***
(x=330, y=630) Antidote
(x=840, y=440) Scroll of Power Word: Stun
(x=1270, y=800) tainted Antidote

***TRAPS***
(x=700, y=850)
(x=720, y=700)
(x=900, y=750)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
23) Now that I've explained it, where you want to go is through the door
at (x=550, y=440), which is locked (as are the other two doors). Inside
the small room beyond is a secret door (x=550, y=300), beyond which is
a tunnel that ends in a door leading to another area (x=1220, y=150).
I'm sure this was meant to be an exhilirating chase, but if you applied
a Mass Invisibility before confronting the Luremaster, this is more of a
casual stroll. Just as well, I find this place annoying.

Note: As an added benefit to taking the sneaky approach, the Olive
Slimes will not follow you to the exit. This is a good thing, because
you cannot immediately rest in the next area, leaving you with only two
options: 1) fight your way through the next level until you find a place
where you can rest, or 2) return to this area and rest here. Obviously
option #2 isn't possible if you've got a horde of Olive Slimes near the
exit.

Catacombs (AR9800)
o======================================================================o
1) New area, new enemies. You'll likely be bothered by them in short
order, whether you go looking for trouble or not. These new foes are
Jackal Warriors, Greater Jackals, and Jackal Shaman. The first two are
strictly melee foes, and although I could read off stats to you, just
know that they're not as strong as the Spectral Guards we were fighting
earlier. They do, however, have a gaze attack, which can knock
characters unconscious if they fail a Save... not very friendly,
especially since Chaotic Commands doesn't block it, for some reason.
Jackal Shaman are 15th-level Clerics with a mediocre selection of
spells... and for some reason, Insect Plague, which they shouldn't have
access to. All in all... they're just so much fodder. Kill any Jackals
that show up while you head north, then follow the tunnel east. There
are plenty of traps here to keep you occupied, even if the Jackals fail
to do so.

Note: You cannot rest in this area, so either return to the previous
area if you need to rest, or pace yourself. Buffs like Haste and
Righteous Wrath of the Faithful will fatigue you, so unless you're
certain you can rest, don't use them. Of course... since we snuck past
the Olive Slimes in the last area, we can just head back there and
rest. You did sneak past them, right...?

***HoF***
If you get hit by a Jackal Shaman's Flame Strike spell, you'll regret
it, so be sure to focus on them first.

***TRAPS***

(x=690, y=300)
(x=950, y=400)
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
2) Disarm all the traps ever made (again) and continue east until you
reach a fork. To the south-east are a trio of Phase Spiders gaurding a
doorway at (x=1600, y=300), while the south is... well, we'll get to the
south shortly. There's a puzzle we need to solve to advance out of these
caverns, but it'll be easier to explain it after we uncover some of its
components. So... head through the doorway the Phase Spiders were
guarding.

Altar of Earth Chamber (AR9801)
o======================================================================o
3) As soon as you enter you'll be beset by a bastardly bunch of bad
bugs-three Wraith Spiders, two Sword Spiders, and a pair of Bombardier
Beetles. Exterminate them and head south to enjoy another swarm of
buggy baddies-a Wraith Spider, two Sword Spiders, and two Bombardier
Beetles. This configuration of foes might have been almost a challenge
back in Dragon's Eye, but by now, it's cheese. In this second chamber
you'll find a chest (x=2300, y=850) which contains a Flawed Emerald*1.
What do we do with this little gem, you ask? Well, take a sneaking or
invisible character and head east to find a small side-chamber, in which
an altar is guarded by two Stone Nuisances. A more aptly-named foe there
has never been, these critters love pelting you with Magic Missiles, and
they will respawn every time you return to this area... which is
unfortunate, considering how this puzzle works. See that altar
(x=2660, y=1160)? In Infinity Explorer it's called the 'Altar of Earth',
and if you click on the stone triangle (x=2700, y=1150) north of the
altar you'll get the following text:

"This inlaid stone has a rune carved upon it. The rune is often
translated as the symbol for Earth."

The altar is empty right now, so there's no real need to mess with it-
or the Stone Nuisances guarding it. Suppose there's any connection
between the gem we just got and the altar? You do? Well, aren't you a
smart cookie! Just keep these altars in mind for a bit-we've got more
pieces of this puzzle to uncover before I bother boring you with how
this puzzle works in full.

***ITEMS***
(x=2300, y=850) Flawed Emerald*1

*1: Yes, this is a quest item-we'll need it to leave these caverns, so
you should probably hold onto it.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
4) Leave this area and head back to the Jackal-occupied caverns
(AR9800) by going back out the way you came in (x=2200, y=400).
Backtrack to the west a bit, and take the southern fork we ignored
earlier. Here is where the various Jackals we encountered earlier
were originally positioned-and here they'll be still if they didn't
bother you earlier in Step #1. Kill whatever presents itself and loot
a few chests while heading south. Eventually you'll stumble upon another
doorway-which is our next destination (x=1300, y=1300).

***ITEMS***
(x=550, y=550) Spear +3: Backbiter*1, Scimitar +3: Frostbrand*2,
	       Studded Leather +2: Missile Attraction*3
(x=1220, y=800) Hell's Bane*4
(x=1270, y=900) Potion of Heroism, Elixir of Health, 1800 gold

*1: Ah... the chest at (x=550, y=550) will drop loot with some things
in common. First, it all starts with 'S'. Second, it's got those fun
enhancment bonus/colon names. Third, everything in it sucks, but to
varying degrees. The Spear +3: Backbiter isn't just an underpowered
weapon by now (Slayer is a guaranteed drop, and it's a +5 weapon), it
also harms its user in combat. What a piece of shit.
  ---
*2: Eh, Drizzt's Scimitar again. This is what, the third one of these
we've found by now-all guaranteed drops? By now we've found at least
two Scimitars better than it. At least it's not a cursed butt-biter,
though.
  ---
*3: Speaking of butt-biters, this humble, well-outdated suit of... +2
Studded Leather... comes with a price. No, worse than just downgrading
to +2 Studded Leather. It makes your Armor Class count as 15 versus
missile weapons... or in other words, it gives you a +10 Armor Class
penalty. That's pretty awful, even if ranged attacks are uncommon in
Icewind Dale.
  ---
*4: It's a pretty mediocre weapon, but after the last few nut-butters,
it seems grand, indeed. This is a... normal Long Sword with some Fire
Resistance. Unless you pit it against Baatezu and Tanar'ri-demons and
devils. Then it deals 2d8 damage and acts as a +4 weapon (+4 to hit and
damage rolls.) Not terrible... but by now we've got weapons like... oh,
I don't know... the Long Sword of Action +4? It's +4 all the time, gives
and extra attack per round, and, well... you know.

Altar of Heaven Chamber (AR9801)
o======================================================================o
5) No welcoming party this time, just head north-west from where you
spawn and score a chest (x=1800, y=1220) containing a Flawed Skydrop
Gem*1. Two down, and unknown number to go (unknown to you, anyways,
unless you read ahead, you clever critter.) Continue south-west to find
a rather cowardly Minotaur, who'll beg you not to kill him before
running off. 'Kay...

***ITEMS***
(x=1800, y=1220) Flawed Skydrop Gem*1

*1: Durh... quest item much?
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
6) I suggest you spell-buff now-how much is, of course, up to you, but
the upcoming fight can be rather nasty. Focus on making yourself potent
in a straight melee fight, then position your party in the tunnel just
south-west of the chest with the Flawed Skydrop Gem... you know, that
old bottle-neck trick again. Once done, sneak to the north with an
invisible/sneaking character until you find yourself in a room full of
nasty Minotaurs, Minotaur Elders, and a Minotaur Lord. They will-through
the power of magic and bad coding-'detect' your hidden character and
respond with inspired floating text remarks. Since they can't attack
your hidden character, however, they'll instead beeline for your party,
who should be ready for them. You can expect about a dozen foes, in
all. The Minotaur Elders are each roughly comparable with the Spectral
Guards we fought earlier, and superior to the 'MINCAT' Minotaurs
ecountered earlier (103 Hit Points, 18/50 Strength, better Saves,
slightly better THAC0.) The Minotaur Lord is the real threat, however.
Although its stats are rightfully superior to even the Minotaur
Elder's (142 Hit Points, 19 Strength, even better Saves and THAC0),
what makes it really dangerous is its weapon, which has a 25% chance
to stun. A stunned character in the middle of this furious melee is
probably a dead once, so keep a Remove Paralysis handy, and hope your
Stoneskin is potent enough to save stunned characters. What's that?
You say you don't have an uber-triple class party full of characters
who can apply Stoneskin? Sucks for you. Just to rub it in, throwing out
a few debilitative spells (Chaos, Symbol of Hopelessness, Slow) will go
a long way towards winning this fight. Once they're all dead, loot the
Minotaur Lord for the Axe of the Minotaur Lord*1, a Ring of Free Action,
and a Cloak of Displacement. A well-equipped beastie, indeed.

***HoF***
This fight can be hellish for an unprepeared or under-powered party,
and I take it fairly seriously. Simply considering the potency and
number of foes you'll have to fight, you should spell-buff to the max.
I even take the rare step of casting Summon Monster VII in front of my
party, summoning enough Umber Hulks/Boneguard Skeletons to hit the
summon limit. Another special measure I take is to cast Free Action on
all my Clerics-anybody who will be exposed to melee combat should take
the step of rendering themselves immune to that Minotaur Lord's Axe.
Once done, I simply run up with a character, provoke the Minotaurs,
and run back. I blast them liberally with Symbol of Hopelessness,
Slow, and Chaos, hopefully neutralizing almost all opposition before
I bother to engage with my party-my summons distract the enemies until
I'm tired of throwing spells at them. After such exhaustive
preparations, my party begins cutting down anything with a red circle
under its feet. The amount of time this chore takes-mostly unopposed-
should give you an idea of how dangerous this fight could have been.
In the end, I take absolutely no damage-but before we tout this rout,
just keep in mind that Heart of Fury mode fights tend to go this way-
utter victory, or utter defeat, dependant, of course, on preparation and
execution.

*1: If you were to just look at this axe's statistics, without reading
the descriptive text above, you'd conclude (rightly) that this is a
piece of junk. In reality it's a +4 one-handed axe that has a 25% chance
of stunning foes for 1d4 rounds each hit... making it the best Axe in
the game, as far as I'm concerned. What's the next best competition?
Battle Axe +3: Fatigue? Battle Axe +2: Defender? Young Rage? This Axe
has a good enhancement bonus and a useful effect, making it a win in
my book. Compared to the Long Swords, Daggers, and Morning Stars we've
found, it's still an inferior melee weapon, however.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
7) Now that we've effectively cleared this area out, we've got two
paths ahead of us-north or south. It might be more tempting to head
north, to where the bulk of the Minotaurs came from, but we've more
important business to the south. Head south, and cross a natural stone
bridge to the north-west to come across a chest (x=750, y=1450),
which has a triangle in front of it bearing the following description:

"Seasons change all that we know."

Cryptic, eh? Here's how this works-those stupid flawed gems you've been
finding? We need them less flawed. So when you get ahold of them, bring
them to this chest and chuck them in. Good enough? Not on your life...
After we've deposited them in this chest, they'll vanish in a magical
burst of radiance-reappearing in one of the altars strewn about this
area. Since the Stone Nuisances return, we might as well just collect
all the flawed stones, bring them to this chest (called the Chest of
Seasons, in case anybody else cares), then go collect them from their
altars. We'll get a chance to put this into effect immediately-head up
the northern tunnel where we teased the Minotaurs into attacking to
find the Altar of Heaven (x=730, y=430) guarded by a pair of Stone
Nuisances. Once they're disposed of, search the altar for a Flawless
Star Sapphire*1. Our old Flawed Skydrop Gem got an upgrade, it seems.

***HoF***
Stone Nuisances are somewhat more annoying in Heart of Fury mode-that
Magic Missile of theirs has the potential to do some serious damage.
By the time I bother tackling this place in Heart of Fury mode, however,
all have 154 Hit Points and 45% Magic Resistance. I honestly found that
I was healing almost as fast as they were damaging me. Before any
serious damage could be done, they were dead. Not everything has to be
a chore in Heart of Fury mode, you know.

***ITEMS***
(x=730, y=430) Flawless Star Sapphire*1

*1: Quest. Keep.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
8) So... yeah, now you get what we're going to be doing for the next
couple of Steps. Find Flawed gems, drop them all in the Chest of
Seasons, retrieve Flawless gems from the Altars... the very definition
of fetch-quest (and shamelessly padding your game.) Exit this area
(x=2200, y=1500) and return to the Altar of Earth area (x=1600, y=300).
Go to the Altar of Earth (x=2660, y=1160), destroy the Stone Nuisances,
and collect the Flawless Diamond*1.

***ITEMS***
(x=2660, y=1160) Flawless Diamond*1

*1: An emerald turns into a diamond as part of an upgrade? I take
offense to that! Emeralds are an infinity times better than diamonds-
they're green! Oh. Right. Quest. Keep. Just... paint it green or
something.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
9) Return to (AR9800) and head south, past the doorway to the Altar of
Heaven Chamber. South you'll find a large chamber occupied by a new
foe-Summoners. They're at the southern end of a summoning henge, and
are guarded by some Jackal Warriors, Jackal Shaman, and worst of all...
Bats. Yes, Bats. The Summoners will regularly conjure Glabrezu-
moderately powerful demons. They'll do this indefinitely until you kill
them... whether this is useful, or annoying, is a matter of perspective.
On one hand, they're each worth 12,000 experience, so you can grind
here, if you wish. Then again, they each have 120 Hit Points, a very
good Armor Class, get many attacks per round (with a low THAC0) and have
22 Strength. The Shaman drop suits of Studded Leather +2 and a Quarter
Staff +1. The Summoners will each cough up a Ring of Protection +2 and
a Robe of the Evil Archmagi. Fortunately, although the Summoners are
troublesome by proxy (via their Glabrezu) they really don't have much
else to attack you with. Be sure to loot, then spell-buff liberally
before heading through a doorway at (x=300, y=2600).

***HoF***
Although this is a relatively minor engagement, the enemy configuration
can still prove somewhat troublesome-any spell-casters hiding behind
melee meat shields can do that. Yes, even the Bats are resilient enough
to get in your way-and an isolated character surrounded by Bats and a
Glabrezu is in trouble. I suggest some spell-buffing here, and a
debilitator or two wouldn't hurt. The fact that the Summoners can-and
will-summon up an infinite horde of foes really means you should
endeavor to pay attention to them, and Glabrezu are wretchedly strong
in Heart of Fury mode. I find with sufficient buffing and liberal use
of disabling spells, I can force my way to the Summoners, kill them,
then mop up. It won't be pretty... but then again, fighting off a half
dozen Glabrezu would get even uglier.

***ITEMS***
(x=330, y=2130) Scroll*1
(x=470, y=2370) Oil of Fiery Burning, Potion of Absorption,
		Potion of Magic Shielding

*1: A note that talks about some 'device' around here that will allow
one to escape. It... pretty much spells out the puzzle in this area.
Note the lovely little riddle:

"Heaven above, Earth and Sea below
Sun's flight, Day turns to Night
Seasons change all that we know
Stones numbered five being the gate alive
To home the passage will flow"

Altar of Day Chamber (AR9801)
o======================================================================o
10) This area doesn't mess around-as soon as you enter you'll be hit by
several 'gaze' attacks, which can hinder your offensive outright. With
a little luck (and perhaps some tactical save/loading when luck fails)
you'll get into the fight... more or less intact. Inside this chamber
are three Greater Jackals, two Jackal Shaman, two Stone Nuisances, a
Jackal Pack Leader and ten Jackals... as in, dogs. The reason that this
encounter is so wretched... well, all the Jackals have a gaze effect,
so entering pretty much subjects your party to a barrage of debilatative
spells. We're supposed to be on the giving side of such effects-not the
recieving. In addition, while the Jackals aren't terribly strong in
melee... they're not terribly weak, either. They certainly have enough
Hit Points to get in the way. The Jackal Pack Leader is more or less as
strong as the Glabrezu we fought earlier (125 Hit Points, 20 Strength,
comparable Armor Class, attacks per round and THAC0), and its experience
reward shows it. Still, for a well-buffed party, this fight is only
dangerous if you trip up at the gates. When all opposition has faltered,
loot the chest at (x=800, y=2200) for a Flawed Fire Agate Gem*1. Also
note the altar here (x=520, y=2420):

"This inlaid stone has a rune carved upon it. The
rune is often translated as the symbol for Day."

***HoF***
A fully-buffed party should have little trouble with this room-the foes
here just aren't individually dangerous enough to take out one of my
characters before they can retreat, heal, and rebuff... provided you
don't get knocked unconscious at the beginning. I'm actually somewhat
partial to just skipping this fight, courtesy of Mass Invisibility.
Run in, grab the Flawed Fire Agate, run out. But, that's just because
I'm lazy.

***ITEMS***
(x=800, y=2200) Flawed Fire Agate Gem*1

*1: Tseuq. Peek.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
11) Now, we're ready to move on and collect the rest of these stones.
If you want, go drop this Flawed Fire Agate Gem in the Chest of Seasons,
return to the Altar of Day Chamber and collect the Flawless Sunstone
Gem from the Altar of Day. We need not look back... except for when we
drop off the next Flawed Gems, but you know what I mean. Anyways, return
to the doorway leading to the Chamber of Earth (the one guarded by the
Phase Spiders). From there, continue east-the terrain here is a little
vague, but trust me, you can go east from this door-then south-east.
Eventually you'll reach a more open chamber with a fork. To the east are
some stairs, upon which a pair of Shamblers lurk (and four more buddies
occupy the chamber beyond them). Remember these things? Yeah, they still
suck. Kill the Shamblers-attempt to lure them out one at a time if
possible-you don't want to fight a half-dozen Shamblers all at once.
Despite this fight, there's really nothing over here worth your
attention. Ah well...

***HoF***
Again, the trick to taking down Shamblers is electrical damage-Shocking
Grasp, in my case. I buff one character with Stoneskin, then have them
lure the Shamblers-one a time-back to the party, where they are
summarily electrocuted.

***ITEMS***
(x=520, y=2420) Flawless Sunstone Gem
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
12) Now head west to find a friendly... or at least, non-hostile
Jackalwere named Rikasha. He'll tell you about his people's life on the
surface, their improbable fall, and even more absurd survival.
Essentially, they built a magical teleporter to get back to the
surface... I suppose in a fantasy world it's easier to build a mass
teleportation device than it is to tunnel out-even through fused rock.
One would think anybody sophisticated enough to create a magical
teleporter could, you know, cast a few disintegrate spells to clear the
way, or conjure some mining tools. But, I digress (it's what happens
when a story has holes in it.) He'll also tell you about speaking to
Shaman 'back the way we came', and will mention Hobart-explaining the
Luremaster's game if you somehow hadn't been paying attention. Best of
all, Rikasha will heal you (as a Cleric-for a price) and will let you
rest for free. Score.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
13) From Rikasha, head south-west and follow a narrow tunnel until you
reach a more open chamber. Ahead of you will be one Greater Jackal...
but you can guess he's got buddies lurking nearby. Don't bother with the
bottleneck-this time numbers favor you. Rush the Jackal and make sure
your party gets into the open. In total I smote seven Jackal Warriors
or Greater Jackals in this area-but they all didn't show up at once.
Clear out the chamber to the south, loot, spellbuff (add 'Remove Fear'
to your usual buffing) then go through a doorway at (x=1600, y=2600).

***ITEMS***
(x=2140, y=2340) Scroll of Icelance, Scroll of Ice Storm,
		 Scroll of Stoneskin, Scroll of Emotion: Hopelessness
(x=2500, y=2520) Potion of Hill Giant Strength, Violet Potion,
		 Potion of Invulnerability, Potion of Agility
(x=2600, y=2540) Oil of Speed, Potion of Absorption, tainted Antidote,
		 Potion of Genius

Altar of Sea Chamber (AR9801)
o======================================================================o
14) Why the buffing? Why the Remove Fear? This chamber is occupied by
Harpies-normal, Fiendish, and Infernal. The first two we've already
met, but Infernal Harpies? They've got fewer Hit Points than their
Fiendish counterparts (113 instead of 120), but their Armor Class and
THAC0 are both exceptionally low, and they boast 19 Strength. They can
also cast spells (Magic Missile, Agannazar's Scorcher, Flame Arrow, and
Dire Charm) and are completely immune to fire. Even with spell-buffing,
you need to be on your toes, as you start out flanked. The initial foes
will be to the north, but a larger horde will come from the west. I
prefer to try and quickly smite the Infernal Harpies to the north, then
turn to face the western ones... but you can just as easily hold at
the doorway. Once they're all dead, grab the Flawed Pearl*1 from the
chest at (x=3300, y=2450). The Altar of Sea is at (x=1600, y=1820),
along with its guardian Stone Nuisances. By now, you should know what
to do-dump the Flawed Pearl in the Chest of Seasons, return and grab
the Flawless Waterstar Gem... I shouldn't need to guide you around for
you to accomplish this task.

***HoF***
This fight is nothing a fully-buffed party can't handle. If you want to
secure extra safety against the Inferal Harpy's spells, add Globe of
Invulnerability to your buffs.

***ITEMS***
(x=3300, y=2450) Flawed Pearl*1
(x=1600, y=1820) Flawless Waterstar Gem

*1: ...
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
15) Return to (AR9800) and head north into the tunnels, leaving the
Jackal-occupied chamber with the stream running through it behind. If
you go north-west, you'll get back to Rikasha (should you need resting),
if you go north-east... well, new stuff awaits. North-east, then? Yes.
Spell-buffing might be in order, as a small horde of Jackals await you-
Greater Jackals, Jackal Shaman, another Summoner, and the Glabrezu he
summons. I'm generous with my Symbols of Hopelessness, and they're
generous about dying. Once again, when all is said and done, loot the
Shaman and Summoner if you care to. There's a container to loot along a
ledge to the south-west, and to the west is a encircled pentagram-the
universal symbol of a magical gate, of course. We're not ready to mess
with it yet, so just ignore it.

***ITEMS***
(x=3200, y=2450) Scroll of Summon Shadow, Scroll of Demishadow Monsters,
		 Scroll of Tenser's Transformation,
		 Scroll of Monster Summoning VII
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
16) Instead of doing any half-measures with the gate, head north of it,
and follow a path as it twists around back west. You'll find a chest and
a door to loot, and south of here are more tunnels. Explore them, smite
some Sword Spiders (for them, in all), and head through a doorway at
(x=2300, y=1400). You... ah... might want to buff before entering-focus
on making yourself proof against melee.

***ITEMS***
(x=2900, y=1000) Longbow of Marksmanship, Arrows of Fire x17
(x=2800, y=1080) Ring of Animal Friendship*1, Tranquil Bolt x6

*1: Quest. Keep. Err... sorry, habit. Not a quest item, it's a piece of
garbage ring imported from Baldur's Gate. You will never need to use
this.

Altar of Night Chamber (AR9801)
o======================================================================o
17) A new area, another new foe-Dire Bears. These things really aren't
screwing around. They have 120 Hit Points, some the of lowest Armor
Class in the game, the lowest base THAC0 possible (1), five attacks per
round, 50% fire resistance, 50% acid resistance, 75% cold resistance,
and 25% resistance to all physical damage. Oh, and 19 Strength, and they
do a base of 1d20 damage a hit. Taking them seriously yet? You should.
If you spell-buffed, they'll be cheese, it not... it can be a rough
fight, indeed. Once they've been tamed, loot the chest at
(x=2900, y=1770) for your final Flawed Gem-a Flawed Moonbar Gem. You
know what to do-dunk it in the Chest of Seasons, return and loot the
Altar of Night (x=2860, y=460) for a Flawless Moonstone Gem. Huzzah!
Now, let's go check out that gate we ignored earlier...

***ITEMS***
(x=2900, y=1770) Flawed Moonbar Gem
(x=2860, y=460) Flawless Moonstone Gem
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
18) This puzzle is mostly done, only a little memory-testing left...
which is a non-issue for you, since you have me to do your remembering
for you. And for free! Man, I'm such a sucker... Anyways, before we go
dropping our gems in these slutty holes, I should mention what happens
if you place your jewels in the wrong... slot... Heh... Defile these
holes and this gate will summon five Cornugons to attack you... remember
these things? Like the buddies Belhifet brings with him in Heart of Fury
mode? No? Just me? Well, anyways, they each have 105 Hit Points, have
an exceptionally low Armor Class, are immune to fire, 50% resistant to
cold, 50% resistant to magic, get three attacks per round, and have a
Strength score of 19. Yeah, they can be pretty bastardly, but there's
no need to ever bother with them... so... just make sure you don't put
your gems in the wrong slot and you'll never have to deal with these
demons. The correct combinations are as follows:

	o=======o=======================o=======================o
	|Symbol	|      Coordinates	|         Gem		|
	o=======o=======================o=======================o
	|Heaven |   (x=3250, y=1970)	|Flawless Star Sapphire |
	|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
	|  Day	|   (x=3360, y=1970)    | Flawless Sunstone Gem |
	|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
	| Earth |   (x=3400, y=2050)	|   Flawless Diamond	|
	|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
	|  Sea	|   (x=3320, y=2090)	|Flawless Waterstar Gem |
	|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
	| Night	|   (x=3320, y=2050)	|Flawless Moonstone Gem |
	o=======o=======================o=======================o

Once the gems are all in place, the portal will activate, and you'll
get an experience reward. Go visit Rikasha one last time, rest, and
get ready for this all to be over with. If you plan to do another
playthrough, take all your gear you want to keep out of Bags of Holding,
and above all-spellbuff like you've only spellbuffed a few dozen times
before. That's right, it's a big fight a-comin'. When you're ready,
step onto the portal (x=3300, y=2020).

***REWARD***
EXP	30000

Castle Maluradek (AR9711)
o======================================================================o
19) The Luremaster will talk to you as soon as you arrive, and make the
same request Kaylessa did so long ago-he wants you to put the spirits
of this castle to rest... naturally by killing them. Because what's more
restful than a violent death? He wants a glorious, epic, bardly battle
to end this tale, and we've no choice but to give him one. It's not as
easy as just pummling one stupid Bard, however-the Luremaster (known as
a 'Spectral Figure' for this fight) will summon up a host of Spectral
Heroes. Their stats aren't important-just know that they're strong
enough to be a bother-and some of the initial heroes are figures we've
met before-Hobart, Harald, Criek, Adrian, and Shelhai all return, for
example. The big problem is, of course, Criek, and for the same reason
he was an asshole the first time we fought him. His sole ambition is
to get off a Dispel Magic. If he succeeds... well, this fight isn't
too rough. Keep your essential buffs (Haste and Stoneskin) active and
attack the Luremaster-only the Luremaster. After chasing him around for
a bit, he should fall, upon which time his Spectral Heroes will vanish.
For all that hassle, the throne will open up (x=860, y=360), and we'll
be free to claim our prize: a Tarnished Ring. Grab it, and the door
out will open. Equip the ring, use it as an inventory item (see that
little backpack on your GUI?) and you'll be transported back to
Lonelywood. We've completed the Trials of the Luremaster.

***HoF***
This fight plays out pretty much the same way it did in normal mode,
save one important difference-you absolutely MUSt prevent the Spectral
Hero (Criek) (x=1300, y=470) from casting Dispel Magic. As soon as the
fight begins, take your party over to him and smite him. With any luck
you can take him down before he gets his wretched spell off. If you do,
you should be good-focus exclusively on the Luremaster and keep an eye
on your buffs. If they run out, reapply them. Having several Stoneskins
for everybody helps immensely. If you get hurt, Heal. You've got until
Haste/Righteous Wrath of the Faithful ends to chase down and dispatch
the Luremaster-if you end up fatigued, you're done.

|								       |
o======================================================================o
Below is a list of the various rare or unique items you can find in the
game. If the item has a name or is otherwise unusual you'll find it in
the section below, regardless of its quality. Therefore I'll record
named items of dubious quality (Long Sword +2: 'Varscona') , but
magical items of the same quality may not be recorded (Long Sword +2).
Perhaps I just like to think that the developers had a reason for
naming the item? I have only included items that I have actually found
in-game, so there may be some random drops that I simply have not seen
yet. I did this because Black Isle and Bioware shared a lot of resources
with each other on these Infinity Engine games, so weapons from Baldur's
Gate are often in the data files-even though they are never used. Also,
some items were cut before being added into the game. Instead of relying
on guesses or hearsay, I've decided to simply play it safe. Everything
below I have found personally at some point or another.

Finding Recorded Items in the Walkthrough			{ITM002}
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
You can simply do a search of the item's name to find the item's
location in the FAQ, or you can search the area number listed by the
item. Keep in mind, however, that many of the items in this game are
random drops, which is denoted with an '~' next to the area number.
For example, Mithral Field Plate Armor +2 is a guaranteed drops in
Dorn's Deep (AR6002), but the Elven Chainmail of the Hand +3 in the
Severed Hand ~(AR5202) is not. On the other hand, searching for the name
could prove fruitless as well if the full name is broken up by a line
change in the Walkthrough. This can be overcome by searching for a key
word in the name (i.e. 'Hand +3' in Elven Chainmail of the Hand +3).
Of course, even this isn't fool proof, as some key items are mentioned
frequently throughout the guide (Blessed Helm of Lathander, for
instance). Then you have cases such as with the Ring of Free Action,
where the key words 'Free Action' appears as a spell that may be
mentioned without any connection to the item.. or more likely, as part
of an early game strategy involving said ring. It's not a perfect system
by any means, but having an index dedicated to the items is better than
nothing at all, even with all its flaws. Of course if you actually read
the Walkthrough you'll get everything worth getting, so you really have
no *real* reason to gripe, do you?

Items will be listed in alphabetical order, and multiple items of the
same sort will be listed by lowest to highest area number, for
organizational purposes. Randomly occuring items will be noted with an
'~' next to their area number (AR####). For example, the Reinforced
Large Shield +1 at ~(AR3502) is random, the one at (AR9201) is not.
Items that only occur in Heart of Fury mode (technically Insane
difficulty) will be denoted with an ***HoF***. This only occurs due to
the addition of new foes to certain encounters.

Note that in Icewind Dale, you can easily tell approximately when in
the game you can obtain most of these items by paying attention to the
area numbers. The lower the number, the earlier you can get the item,
as noted on the list below. The only exception to this rule are items
from Orrick-as he replenishes his stock throughout the game, yet
remains in Kuldahar. Story progression is required to have access to
some of his items.

Below I have listed all the Mage spell scrolls in the game that I have
found. They are organized by spell level, then alphabetically. Each
instance of each spell has been recorded by area number (AR####). Some
spells have more than one copy that can be found in each area (usually
purchased from merchants). Multiple instances of the same spell in the
same area will be noted with multiple copies of the same area number.
Random drops are noted with an '~', as always.

|			Contact Other Plane {COP001}		       |
|								       |
o======================================================================o
Contact Other Plane is an interesting 5th-level Mage spell that allows
you to summon a 'Planar Spirit', which will answer one question before
departing. Each time you cast the spell, you're entitled to ask another
question. The questions vary by chapter, and typically you can ask about
the dispositions/locations of NPCs, treasure, or quest objectives. The
Planar Spirit is, of course, vague. The whole bullshit background of
phony spiritualism in reality has forever-more tainted the fantasy
genre. Because of charlatan mediums, psychics, and prophets-going all
the way back to the babbled absurdity of the Delphic oracle, the bogus
carnie creed of 'mysticism' has always been to keep it vague-then, no
matter what happened, you could pretend that you actually predicted it-
everybody else was just too stupid to figure it out! Of course, if it
were real, why would it need to be vague? Because if you're specific,
it's obvious when you're wrong, and there's no wiggle-room. Of course,
in the fantasy genre, magic is supposed to be 'real' (real fantasy, now
there's an oxymoron...) so why do people keep interposing the phony
habits of reality-where magic, spiritualism, and religion are all false-
with the fantasy genre? For the same reason that small green aliens are
forever-more incapable of speaking a sentence in proper order... it's
just become a staple of the genre. Anyways, this section will discuss
what you can ask the Planar Spirit in each chapter, and its reponses.
Remember, you can only ask a question about a subject if you know the
subject. You cannot ask the Spirit about Vexing Thoughts if you've never
encountered Vexing Thoughts, for example.

Prologue							{COP002}
o======================================================================o
"You have questions for the spirits, yes?  Hasten your mouths with
 queries, for we thirst to return to our own."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What can the spirits tell me of the heroes of Easthaven?"

Answer: "We count many dead among those whom Hrothgar has slain. All are
	 also counted among the wicked and unruly. He and his associate,
	 Everard, are true to their convictions."

	"Accalia is a strong woman, devout and opinionated. Hildreth is
	 a dwarf through and through. Erevain is quick to anger. They
	 are all strong warriors. That is all the spirits can say."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Tell me about the missing caravan."

Answer: "The caravan is gone. Man-beasts plucked the wealth like a plum
	 from a tree and carried it to a cave. They guard it with bow
	 and axe. That is all the spirits know."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What plagues Jhonen?"

Answer: "Jhonen is lost in a sea of his ancestor's elven love. She is
	 trying to give him a tool to fight evil. Its power may give
	 rise to blacker waters. The spirits know no else."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What can the spirits tell me of Pomab?"

Answer: "Pomab's blood runs with the fire of his ancestors, a weak flame
	 that devours all it crawls across. The querant would be wise to
	 watch the snake in the snow. The spirits are deaf to all other
	 knowledge."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Which way lies our fortune?"

Answer: "The querant's fortune lies in the Spine of the World with
	 Hrothgar. The querant must crack those stone bones to get to
	 the heart of the matter. All else is blood and ruin, so say the
	 spirits."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What do you see in the future for Easthaven?"

Answer: "The spirits see red blood on white snow and blue ice. All else
	 is clouded to our perception. We leave you to ponder these
	 things."

Chapter 1							{COP003}
o======================================================================o
"OUR MISERY CANNOT BE ABATED!  CALL OUT YOUR DAMNED QUESTIONS AND BE
 DONE!  THIS DAY, THE SPIRITS BURN FOR *YOU!*"
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Who caused the avalanche that killed Hrothgar?"

Answer: "ALL IS BLACK! OUR SIGHT CANNOT PENETRATE ITS VEIL. SEEK MORE
	 POWERFUL COUNSEL THAN OUR TORMENTED SOULS!"
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What's happening in the Vale of Shadows?"

Answer: "ALL IS AS IT HAS BEEN, THOUGH ONE SEEKS TO END THE MASTER'S
	 ETERNAL SLEEP! SHE IS PART OF SOME GREATER SCHEME! WE LEAVE YOU
	 NOW!"
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What can the spirits tell me of Arundel?"

Answer: "HE AND THE GREAT TREE ARE KIN. POWERFUL IS HE, THOUGH IN GREAT
	 DANGER. TORMENT US NO LONGER!"
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What can the spirits tell me of Lysan?"

Answer: "SHE IS MORE THAN SHE SEEMS. HER BLOOD RUNS WITH ICE, AND HER
	 VOICE IS FILLED WITH WINTER'S WIND! THIS IS ALL WE CAN SAY!"
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What has become of Conlan's son?"

Answer: "HIS HEART BEATS STILL. HE AWAITS HIS FATE IN A PLACE OF WARMTH
	 AND STONE. ASK US NO MORE! THE PAIN IS TOO GREAT!"
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What is the source of the evil in the Vale of Shadows?"

Answer: "MYRKUL IS THE SOURCE OF EVIL, THOUGH NOT THE EVIL YOU SEEK.
	 THAT EVIL STRIVES TO DESTROY THE EVIL OF THE VALE. ASK NO
	 MORE!"
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Where are the missing priests of Ilmater."

Answer: "IN A PLACE OF GREAT WARMTH AND DECAY, SHE HONORS HER GOD. THE
	 REST IS BLACKNESS."

Chapter 2							{COP004}
o======================================================================o
"The dead see. Begin."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What attacked the Temple of the Forgotten God?"

Answer: "The dead see many trolls, many serpentine creatures, evil
	 priests, wizards, and a host of undead. They are lead by a
	 singular power."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "What has become of Conlan's son?"

Answer: "He lies in the belly of the rock of dying flame. He is guarded
	 by eight-legged fiends and scaled men. Kill their king and slay
	 the boy's guardians. Then he will be free."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Where are the missing priests of Ilmater?"

Answer: "The martyr let herself be captured by the oppressors. She is
	 surrounded by poisonous clerics. There are no other missing
	 priests."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Which way lies our fate?"

Answer: "Down, into a bed of steam and rock. Kill the queen of the
	 serpents. She is fiercely guarded. She holds the key."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "I seek powerful magic. Where may I find it?"

Answer: "There is magic guarded by the king of the lizards. Two corpses
	 also hold weapons of great power. Seize them, and the trolls
	 will fall easily to your attacks."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Who created the undead lieutenants?"

Answer: "Presio, a priestess of contagion. She and the frost maid
	 conspired to create them. The dead behind the lieutenants hold
	 the powers of both Talona and Auril."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Tell me of Albion and the Eldathyn."

Answer: "Scales shift beneath their skin, and their blood runs cold.
	 Seek out clues to expose them. Beware the mage and the High
	 Summoner. Free the captured heroes keep death from your
	 hearts."
<---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Question: "Who is the odd little girl?"

Answer: "She is a matron of war, with a form more terrifying than the
	 one you have seen. She is heavily guarded by traps, priests,
	 and powerful warriors. Use your most powerful weapons against
	 her. Abstain from flame, as she was born from such matter. The
	 water that burns, it is your salvation."

|								       |
o======================================================================o
Version 1.00: (190,837 bytes)

o======================================================================o
Version 1.01 Changes: (192,274 bytes)

 o=o	Made numerous spelling/consistency correctons.

 o=o	Reformated the guide to incorporate the 'Sequence of Events' and
	'Steps' intially found in my Mass Effect guide.

 o=o	Played through the game a fourth time-adding new gear as
	necessary.

o======================================================================o
Version 1.02 Changes: (347,138 bytes)

 o=o	Added the Heart of Winter expansion to the guide.

 o=o	Played through the game another two times, adding new gear as
	necessary.

 o=o	Played through the game on Heart of Fury difficulty, and added
	numerous Heart of Fury notes, where necessary.

 o=o	Changed the 'Syrenil "Softstep"' character from a Thief/Mage to
	a Fighter/Mage/Thief to cope with HoF mode.

 o=o	Changed Amirule Alteslay from an evil Fighter/Cleric to a good
	Fighter/Cleric, also for HoF mode.

 o=o	Changed Ceyalya Ceiriladon from a Ranger/Cleric to a
	Fighter/Cleric, as it's more potent.

o======================================================================o
Version 1.03 Changes: Started: 9/23/2012 (1,124,211 bytes)
		      Completed: 3/25/2013

 o=o	Added the Trials of the Luremaster dungeon pack to the guide.

 o=o	Did a massive revision of the walkthrough, making it more
	descriptive, better written, and added more Steps and Sequences.
	It's now a much better guide, as a result. To give an idea of
	the scale of the revision, v1.02 had nine walkthrough Sequences
	and 212 Steps, while v1.03 has thirty walkthrough Sequences
	and 456 Steps.

 o=o	Changed various item notes to refer only to my new party-old
	party relics have been removed.

 o=o 	Made numerous spelling/consistency corrections.

 o=o	Reformated the guide-again-to bring it on par with my Baldur's
	Gate guides.

 o=o	Added descriptions of all the character classes.

 o=o	Revamped my party one more time... mostly to appeal to my power-
	gamey nature and really min-max around the level 30 maximum.
	All the dual-classers are gone, now replaced by more potent
	triple-classers, who can reach level 30 in every class.

 o=o	Adjusted the Abilities tables to reflect what the game's 2DA
	files indicate... and reformatted them to make them more
	prettiful. It's a word if I use it like one.

 o=o	Added the 'Thief Abilities' section.

 o=o	Added the 'Spell Tactics' section.

 o=o	Added the 'Items' Section.

 o=o	Added the 'List of Mage Spells' section.

 o=o	Added the 'Contact Other Plane' section.

 o=o	Checked various gameplay elements in Infinity Explorer, then
	corrected the guide to make it more fact-friendly.

Special Thanks
o======================================================================o

  o=o	My girlfriend, for putting up with me for all these years and
	allowing me to waste so much time working on these games. Even
	better, since she's played through many of these games herself,
	she's often been able to proof-read my guides and offer advice
	based on her own gameplay experience. Could a guy ask for a
	better girlfriend? No. For all you guys out there who have
	settled for some snippy bitch who hates your gaming-dump her
	and find someone better. You can find a girl who loves you AND
	loves to game, if you bother to look.

  o=o	Lee Kadel, for putting more work into these guides than any
	sane person would. What started with him bugging me about a...
	bug... in Baldur's Gate 2 has, over time, led to scores of
	E-mails. These E-mails have prompted several version updates,
	based upon his astute suggestions and resulted in these guides
	becoming truly gold-standard works. Every FAQ-writer should be
	so lucky to have a contributor like Lee.

 o=o	Dmitry Jemerov, the creator of Infinity Explorer. This program
	reveals the game's inner workings, which in turn allows me to
	write a more detailed, more accurate guide. I mostly used this
	program to view dialogue files to understand what variables were
	being checked by the game during conversations... but its
	usefulness (and uses) are boundless.

 o=o	Aaron O'Neil, the creator of Dale Keeper. His mods have been a
	blessing for the Infinity Engine games, including Gate Keeper
	(Baldur's gate) and Shadow Keeper (Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of
	Amn). Dale Keeper was used mostly for cosmetic reasons.. and
	also to boost some characters to level 30 so I could see how
	some builds would work, and to test in-depth all the Druid and
	Clerical spells.
