Having written a number of FAQs for AD&D games (Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II
Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment), I often get questions on the basics of
the ruleset.  What is THAC0?  What is AC?  How does magic work?  Since I've
done so many different AD&D games, I didn't want to duplicate information in
each one, and so I have created this file.  So the purpose of this document is
to explain these concepts to people who aren't familiar with the AD&D ruleset.

3rd Edition Note:  This document works mostly for the 2nd Edition ruleset.
                   There are several upcoming 3rd Edition rules games -- namely
                   Neverwinter Nights and Pool of Radiance II: Ruins of Myth
                   Drannor.  These are not covered in this FAQ.  And in case
                   you are curious, as of the 3rd Edition the "Advanced" in
                   AD&D is being dropped.  Why?  The "basic" D&D is out of
                   print, so there was nothing for AD&D to be "advanced" from.

                   I also have a 3rd Edition D&D FAQ at GameFAQs.

This document is divided up into a series of Articles, such as the first which
is "Thac0 and Armor Class (AC)".

Article Ø:  Basic Concepts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Dice = Everyone knows what dice are.  The most recognized form of dice is the
         "D6" or the six sided die.  If you find a weapon that deals out 3d6
         worth of Damage, then that means the weapon uses 3 six sided dice for
         a Damage Range of 3 to 18.

  +,-  = Throughout AD&D there are modifiers in both the positive and negative
         directions.  Any + modifier improves a stat, any - modifier degrades
         a stat.  Why is this distinction important?  Some stats are improved
         by decreasing their number, THAC0 for instance.  If you find a +2
         Sword, it improves your THAC0 by 2, which is actually a decrease in
         the overall THAC0 number.  If you had started with 20 you would get
         18.

  Encumberance = The weight that your character is currently holding.
         Depending on how strong she is, she will be able to carry more things.
         In AD&D when you carry close to your limit, you will move slower, and
         if you go over your limit, you won't be able to move at all.  In
         Baldur's Gate, you get the message "Encumbered - Cannnot move."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 1:  THAC0 and Armor Class (AC)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  THAC0 = "To Hit Armor Class 0", of a 20 sided dice the number needed to hit
          an enemy with an AC of 0.  For example, if the THAC0 is 19, a roll of
          19 or higher is needed to hit an enemy with an AC of 0.  A roll of
          1 is always a miss, and a roll of 20 is always a hit, called
          CRITICAL MISS and CRITICAL HIT respectively.

  AC    = Armor Class, roughly how difficult a figure is to hit.  AC starts
          with a base score of 10 and is improved by lowering the number.
          Therefore a 0 AC is better than a 10, and a -10 is better still.

  These two things are what determines when a hit (that scores damage) is made.
  THAC0 is the offensive end of the roll, and AC is the defensive end of the
  roll.

  A successful hit is decided when the random roll is greater than the
  attacker's THAC0 - enemy AC.  If a 15 THAC0 Fighter attacks a 0 AC
  goblin then you must roll 15 or greater. (The game itself usually does the
  rolling for you, but it still follows these mechanics) Remember that a roll
  of 20 will always hit.  So, even if the goblin's AC was -400, if you roll a
  20 you will still hit it.  If the goblin has 10 AC then you need only roll a
  5 or better, etc. (THAC0 - EnemyAC = 15 - 10 = 5)

    Note: Just because you hit, that doesn't mean you'll deal damage. There is
          the concept in second edition D&D of weapon immunities. Some monsters
          require a certain type of weapon to be hit. Also, wizards can cast
          spells such as "Protection from Magic Weapons" which makes them
          temporarily immune to magic weapons. Baldur's Gate represents this by
          having characters say "my weapon is useless" or something similar.

  THAC0 Explained:
  ----------------

    THAC0 defaults at 20 and is gradually lowered when levels are gained.
    Depending on the class (i.e. Fighter, Cleric, Mage) of the person involved
    the THAC0 will decrease at different rates.  For a Fighter (or Ranger, or
    Paladin) THAC0 decreases by a score of 1 per level.  A level 1 Fighter
    starts at 20 THAC0, but by level 10 he is at 11. (He has gained 9 levels,
    and so loses 9 THAC0)  The lower the THAC0 the better, and there is no
    limit to how low it can go.

    THAC0 Progression by Level & Class Chart:
                                            Level
      Group     1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15  16

      Patterns
      --------
      Warrior   1 every level
      Wizard    1 every 3 levels
      Priest    2 every 3 levels
      Rogue     1 every 2 levels

    At this point we're still just referring to RAW THAC0, there are still
    several things that modify it before it is used.  There are, in fact, four
    main things that modify THAC0 from here:  Strength, Weapon, Special
    Effects, and Proficiency.  A super low strength score will raise your THAC0
    (which is bad), while super high Strengths will lower your THAC0 (which is
    good).

    STRENGTH as a THAC0 modifier

        STR     THAC0 Adj.                    STR      THAC0 Adj.
         3         -3                          17         +1
         4         -2                          18         +1
         5         -2                        18/01-50     +1
         6         -1                        18/51-75     +2
         7         -1                        18/76-90     +2
         8          0                        18/91-99     +2
         9          0                        18/00        +3
        10          0                          19         +3
        11          0                          20         +3
        12          0                          21         +4
        13          0                          22         +4
        14          0                          23         +5
        15          0                          24         +6
        16          0                          25         +7

    Notice how any improvement in THAC0 is denoted by a +3 or a +4, while in
    fact these numbers are how much your THAC0 is DECREASED.  A level 1 Fighter
    has 20 THAC0, but if he has 18/00 STR, his THAC0 is decreased to 17.

    The weapon used also has an effect on THAC0, both by the weapon itself and
    also through Proficiency (although Proficiency is an optional rule, and
    of the games listed at the top, only Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment,
    Icewind Dale, and Baldur's Gate II follow this rule).  Generally speaking,
    the amount the THAC0 is changed is the number after the +.  A Long Sword +1
    would improve THAC0 by 1 point.  There are exceptions to this, some weapons
    won't have a + but improve THAC0 anyway, and some will say +1, but will in
    fact improve THAC0 more than 1 point.  In these cases, checking that items
    information will reveal how it modifies THAC0 (only available in some
    games).

      Note: To check the item information in BG1, BG2 and IWD, right click the
            item in the inventory screen. Also note that magical items are very
            often "NOT IDENTIFIED." Meaning that you won't know what they do
            until they are IDENTIFIED.  See the FAQ below.

    Special Effects can be either a spell that improves THAC0 (Bless, for
    instance), or an Item that improves THAC0, but isn't a weapon, such as an
    Amulet of Thac0 +1.

    Proficiency was introduced to show what your character is skilled in, or
    not skilled in.  It has only really been used since Baldur's Gate in 1998.
    Since proficiency represents your character's knowledge of the weapon being
    used, using a weapon that you don't have proficiency in will result in a
    penalty to THAC0 and to Damage.

    PROFICIENCY as a THAC0 Modifier: (Baldur's Gate I & II, Icewind Dale,
                                      Planescape: Torment only)

      Level of Proficiency    Points Spent    Bonus to Hit

      Non-Proficient               0            -2 (Warrior)
                                                -5 (Wizard)
                                                -3 (Priest or Rogue)
      Proficient                   1             0 (but there is no penalty)
      Specialized                  2            +1
      Master                       3            +3
      High Master                  4            +3
      Grand Master                 5            +3

    As you can see, a Wizard using a weapon that he isn't proficient in will
    result in a steep penalty, so he could have 20 THAC0, but because he is
    using the wrong weapon his THAC0 leaps up to 25.

    Dexterity Note:  Dexterity has one small effect on THAC0, but only towards
                     the use of MISSILE WEAPONS (bows, crossbows, etc.).  At
                     a DEX of 16 you get a +1 to hit, 17 & 18 +2, and 19 +3.

  Armor Class Explained:
  ----------------------

    Armor Class isn't really about armor.  It is the composite of Armor and
    Dexterity that determines how hard it is for a damaging hit to be made.
    The base Armor Class (AC) is 10.  Anything lower is better and makes your
    character harder to hit. It does NOT reduce the amount of damage taken.

    The first facet of Armor Class is your Dexterity Score.  The higher the
    Dexterity, the lower (better) your Armor Class.  This reflects your
    character's ability to dodge attacks. So, here, negative numbers are
    better.

    DEXTERITY as an Armor Class Modifier

        DEX       AC Adj.                      DEX      AC Adj.
         3         +4                          14          0
         4         +3                          15         -1
         5         +2                          16         -2
         6         +1                          17         -3
         7          0                          18         -4
         8          0                          19         -4
         9          0                          20         -4
        10          0                          21         -5
        11          0                          22         -5
        12          0                          23         -5
        13          0                          24         -6
                                               25         -6

    Whether you are on level 1 or level 20 your AC is still determined by the
    same two factors, DEX and Armor.  So, a level 1 Fighter with a Dex of 18
    would have an AC of 6 (before putting any armor on, BASE AC(10) +
    DEX ADJ.(-4) = AC).  A level 20 fighter who has no armor would have the
    same AC with the same DEX.

    Which brings us to the BULK of where AC is made up, Armor.  We will divide
    armor into two categories, actual Armor (such as Plate Mail Armor) and
    support Items (such as Ring of Protection +1).

    Armor usually lists what your AC will be based from the Base AC itself.
    So Leather Armor will list its AC as AC 8.  What this means is that if you
    had the base AC of 10, wearing Leather Armor will decrease your AC to 8.
    If you do NOT have the Base AC (and who does), it still decreases your AC
    by 2 points.  If we wanted to determine the AC of our 18 DEX Fighter
    wearing Leather Armor we would need to take the Leather Armor AC(8) +
    Dexterity Bonus(-4) to get 4.  In this way you can think of your Armor's
    AC as REPLACING your Base AC.  So instead of starting at 10, with Leather
    Armor you would start at 8.

    Armor as an AC modifier (not all armors are in all games)

         Armor                  AC

         Leather Armor           8
         Studded Leather         7
         Hide Armor              6
         Scale Mail              6
         Brigandine Armor        6
         Chain Mail              5
         Ring Mail               5
         Elven Chainmail         5
         Drow Chainmail          4
         Banded/Splint Mail      4
         Plate Mail              3
         Field Plate             2
         Full Plate              1

    If an armor is said to be +1, or +2 that means that the armor has an extra
    special bonus attached that further lowers AC by that number.  So a Chain
    Mail +4 would have an AC score of 1 rather than 5.

    In addition to your Armor, AC is also determined by special items being
    worn by the character.  The most common special item is the common shield
    which improves AC by one point (our 4 AC, 18 DEX Leather Armor Fighter
    would then drop to 3 AC with a Shield).  There are various varieties of
    shields, but they all do the same job.  Other items would be Rings of
    Protection or Cloaks of Protection.  These all improve the AC of the
    wearer.

      Note:  Some games (Baldur's Gate, for example) allow only ONE extra
             protective item (not counting shields) to be worn at a time.  This
             includes Magic Armors.  So, if you wore a Chainmail +1, you
             couldn't wear a Ring of Protection +1.  Or, if you had that
             Ring of Protection +1 you couldn't wear the Cloak of
             Protection +1.

    Magic can also function as armor, however, it usually acts in place of
    armor rather than as a bonus to it. Take the spell "Armor" or "Shield" for
    example. They set your AC to 6 and 4, respectively, but if you're wearing
    armor better than either, you get no extra benefit.  There are some spells
    that provide a simple bonus, such as Defensive Harmony (BG1, BG2, IWD), so
    check spell descriptions.

Article 2:  Magic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Magic System used in AD&D is different from almost every other magic
  system out there.  For one thing, there is no "Mana" system, or anything
  similar that most games run on.  So, how does Magic work in the AD&D games?

  First, magic is divided into two main categories, MAGIC-USER and PRIEST.
  This is an important distinction as there are some subtle and some
  not-so-subtle differences between the two.

  Who Casts Which Magic

    Magic User         Priest
    ----------         -------
    Mage               Cleric
    Bard               Paladin (at experience level 9)
    Sorcerer           Ranger (at experience level 8)
                       Druid

  Separate from your EXPERIENCE LEVEL is your spellcaster's SPELL LEVEL.  This
  is an important distinction that a lot of novices miss.  A level 6 mage
  CANNOT cast level 6 spells.  In fact, a mage can't cast level 6 spells until
  he has reached EXPERIENCE LEVEL 12.  There are 9 Wizard SPELL LEVELS but
  only 7 Priest SPELL LEVELS.  However, when a spell says that it becomes more
  powerful "for every 3 levels of the caster" it is referring to EXPERIENCE
  LEVELS rather than SPELL LEVELS.  It's easiest to remember that you gain a
  SPELL LEVEL at every other EXPERIENCE LEVEL.  So a mage starts at level 1,
  and can cast level 1 spells, at level 2, still just level 1 spells, but level
  3, he gains abilities in the 2nd level spells.

  How powerful a spellcaster you are depends on the class of the magic-user or
  priest and on the stats as well.  The Mage, Druid and Cleric are the only
  classes who can learn all spell levels.  Druids and Clerics can only cast
  the 6th and 7th level spells if they have wisdoms of at least 17 or 18
  respectively. (7th level is as far as Priest spells go)

  Spell Level Limit

    Mage          * Depends on Intelligence, see Intelligence Chart below *
    Bard          6
    Ranger        3
    Paladin       4

  This way a Bard can learn up to 6th level wizard spells, and a Ranger can
  learn up to 3rd, but no farther.  You won't find Bards casting level 7 spells
  as it can't happen.

  Now that we understand who can do what, let's talk about how magic works
  more specifically.  There are three steps towards casting a spell (depending
  on the game).

    1. Add a spell to spellbook.  Priests do this automatically and know every
       spell for their spell level.  Mages need to find a spell scroll and
       scribe that spell into their spell book.  Since Mages have to actually
       find a scroll and scribe it in, there is a chance that they might fail,
       which is based on their intelligence. (Clerics already know all spells
       so they can't fail)  There is an intelligence chart later in this
       article.  Mages are further limited by the number of spells they can
       learn per spell level, again this relates to intelligence.

    2. Memorize the spell.  Once the spell is in your spellbook, you need to
       decide which spells you want to "memorize".  Only spells that you have
       memorized can be cast, and they can only be cast once per memorization.
       So if you memorize one Magic Missile, then you can cast one Magic
       Missile.  The number of spells that you can memorize per spell level
       are listed below.  The memorization process usually involves Resting for
       a set amount of time.  Baldur's Gate does this through the spellbook
       (w) and the priest scroll (p) interfaces. Empty boxes represent spell
       slots that are available on the left, with known spells on the right.

    3. And then you can actually cast the spell.  Again, you only get to cast
       a memorized spell once before needing Rest to rememorize it.  If you
       memorized a spell more than once (and you can memorize one spell as
       many times as you have free slots), you can cast it as many times as it
       was memorized.

            EXP LEVEL. Because of this, Paladins make poor spellcasters.

  The final concept that we'll deal with here are the Stat bonuses as they
  relate to spellcasting.  The two stats in question are, of course, WISDOM and
  INTELLIGENCE.  Only Priests gain extra casting spells per level (the number
  of spells which can be memorized and cast), however Mages are very dependent
  upon Intelligence for other things, such as % to scribe a spell into their
  spellbook and how many spells they can know per spell level.  A lot of games
  don't deal with some of these stats.

  So a Mage with only 17 INT can't learn 9th level spells, has a 75% chance to
  copy a scroll into his spellbook, and can only learn 14 spells per level
  anyway.  Thus we see why having an 18 INT mage is important.

  Note:  Bonus spells are cumulative, so an 18 WIS cleric would get +2 1st
         level, +2 2nd level, +1 3rd level and +1 4th level spells.  While a
         13 WIS cleric would get only +1 1st level.

  Also Note:  Paladins and Rangers don't get Bonus Spells.

  Final Note:  If you, or any spellcaster, is hit while casting their spell,
               the spell is interrupted and won't be cast.

Article 3:  Levels
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  With the proliferation of less "realistic" RPG levelling systems, I am often
  asked why your stats never improve when you gain levels, and what levels
  do gain you; which is what this article is all about. (of course, it didn't
  help that Torment DID give you stat increases)

  Basically, there are three things that levels improve: Hit Points, THAC0, and
  Saving Throws. (There are other "secondary" effects of higher levels, such as
  more powerful magics, but that isn't necessary to understand the basics here)

  Hit Points gained per level:

    level     Fighters   Priests   Rogues   Wizards
    -----------------------------------------------
    1 to 9      10         8         6        4
    10+          3         2         2        1

  You gain most of your character's HP during the first 9 levels.  A Fighter
  with average Constitution will gain 10 HP a level, and so could be a level
  9 fighter with 90 HP (assuming that you got max HP each level).  The number
  of HP you get is usually random.  Meaning you can get anywhere from 1 to
  your classes max (in the Fighters case, he would gain between 1 - 10 HP a
  level).

  Also for the first 9 levels you will also gain a Constitution bonus to your
  HP.

  Constitution HP Bonuses:

    CON    HP Adj.             CON    HP Adj.

     3       -1                15      +1
     4       -1                16      +2
     5       -1                17      +2 (+3)
     6        0                18      +2 (+4)
     7        0                19      +2 (+5)
     8        0                20      +2 (+5)
     9        0                21      +2 (+6)
    10        0                22      +2 (+6)
    11        0                23      +2 (+6)
    12        0                24      +2 (+7)
    13        0                25      +2 (+7)
    14        0

    Only Fighters/Paladins/Rangers gain the CON bonus in the parenthesis.
    Because of this, only these classes need a CON score above 16.

  So, a Fighter with 18 CON (the best a Human can get) COULD gain 14 HP a
  level. (the range would be 5-14)

  Finally there are Saving Throws.  Saving Throws represent your character's
  ability to avoid various effects, such as a Death Spell.  If he has good
  enough Saving Throws (and makes the random roll) then he can survive the
  spell.  These also improve as you go up in level, with the lower scores being
  better (just like golf).

  Saving Throws per Level:

                       Para/Pois/           Petrification/   Breath
    Class      Level     Death       Wand     Polymorph      Weapon     Spell
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Priest     1 to 3      10         14          13           16         15

  Items can also improve Saving Throws. A Ring of Protection +1 adds both a +1
  to AC and Saves. At higher levels, saving throws become much more important
  than AC as monsters will use many spells and supernatural abilities against
  you.

    Note:  Saving throws are better when they're lower, and can even go into
           the negatives. However, the random roll is still 1 to 20. Thus,
           someone with a -2 Save vs. Death should always make that save,
           although some spells will state that all saves against that spell
           are made at a penalty.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Article 4:  Multiclassing and Dual Classing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Normally the 2nd Edition AD&D rules allows for 8 character classes:

    Paladin*
    Bard*
    Fighter
    Ranger
    Druid
    Cleric
    Mage
    Thief

    * Cannot be multi/dual classed

  Not all of these classes will be in all games.  There are also combinations
  of these classes called, Multiclasses, where one person can be two or three
  classes at once.  Humans cannot multiclass, they can only Dual class.

  Which multiclass you can be depends on the race of your character.

  Races and Multiclasses:
  -----------------------

    Dwarf                           Halfling
    -----                           --------
    Fighter/Thief                   Fighter/Thief
    Fighter/Cleric
                                    Half-Elf
    Elf                             --------
    ---                             Fighter/Cleric
    Fighter/Mage                    Fighter/Thief
    Fighter/Thief                   Fighter/Druid**
    Mage/Thief                      Fighter/Mage
    Fighter/Mage/Thief              Cleric/Ranger
                                    Cleric/Mage
    Gnome                           Thief/Mage
    -----                           Fighter/Mage/Cleric
    Fighter/Cleric                  Fighter/Mage/Thief
    Fighter/Illusionist*
    Fighter/Thief
    Cleric/Illusionist*
    Cleric/Thief
    Illusionist/Thief*

    *Illusionists are not in all games, this could be considered "mage"
    **Druids are not in all games

  As you can see, Half-Elves are the most versatile of all races when it comes
  to multiclassing.

  Experience for the multiclassed character is divided evenly among his
  various classes.  If a Fighter/Thief gains 1000 experience from killing an
  evil Halfling of Doom, then his Fighter half gains 500 experience and his
  Thief half gains 500 experience.  Thusly, the multiclassed character usually
  levels up at half the speed of "plain" characters. This does not mean that
  this multi- character will be half the levels, he usually is only a couple
  levels behind.

  Hitpoints are handled similarly.  When the Fighter/Thief gains a Fighter
  level, he gains 1/2 the normal Fighter HP.  Fighters normally get 10 HP per
  level, and the Fighter/Thief would gain 5 HP max for a Fighter level and 3
  for the Thief level.  Constitution bonuses are handled in one of two ways:

    1) You get the bonus once per number level.  So, our Fighter/Thief would
       get the CON bonus when his Thief level goes up as that levels up faster.
    2) The CON bonus is divided by your number of classes and you get one part
       per each class' level.  If you were a Fighter/Thief you would still get
       the extra CON for warriors.

  Dual classing is the Human answer to Multiclassing.  At level 2 or higher,
  the human can decide to switch to a new class.  Then for a time he will be
  JUST that class until his new class exceeds the level of his old class.  At
  that point your old classes' abilities return and you become similar to a
  Multiclass... except that you are only levelling one class now, rather than
  dividing your exp amongst classes.

    Note:  As far as I know, only the Baldur's Gate/Infinity Engine games have
           implemented Dual Classing.  Bryan A. Keith mentions that some of
           the later Gold Box games implemented Dual Classing (Curse and
           beyond).

  There are several conditions to Dual Classing:

    1)  You MUST be Human.

    2)  You MUST be at least level 2.

    3)  You MUST start from a Class that can dual.  Paladins/Bards cannot Dual
        to anything, nor can you dual anyone to a Bard/Paladin.

    4)  The combination MUST be a valid "Multiclass."  If you can't find it
        on the list above (ignore the race restrictions), then you can't dual
        it.  An example of an ILLEGAL class would be a Fighter/Ranger.  Not
        a valid Multiclass, so you can't Dual it either.

    5)  You need to have sufficient Stats.  You need at least 15 in the Prime
        Stats of your current class (i.e. 15 STR for a Fighter) and at least
        17 in the Prime Stats of your desired class (i.e. 17 INT for a Mage).

          Note:  Specialist Mages have an extra "Prime Stat" beyond just INT.

    6)  Finally there is also an Alignment Requirement.  Thieves cannot be
        Lawful, so a Lawful Good Fighter cannot Dual to a Thief.  Also Druids
        must be True Neutral.

  So, a level 2, Neutral Good Fighter with 15 STR and 17 DEX can dual to a
  Thief.  While a level 2, Neutral Good Thief with 15 STR and 17 DEX can't
  dual to fighter. (he would need 17 STR and 15 DEX)  When the first
  hypothetical character gained level 3 as a Thief, he would become a
  true Fighter/Thief, however he would only gain Thief levels.

    Note:  It doesn't matter which order you go from.  You can start out as a
           Thief and dual to a Fighter, or a Fighter to a Thief.  It amounts
           to the same thing.  Which way you do it only affects which class
           will continue to gain experience.

Frequently Asked Questions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Q:  What is a CRPG?

  A:  Computer Role Playing Game.


  Q:  Aren't there other AD&D games that you didn't mention in your list?  What
      about the Dragonlance games?

  A:  I am completely unfamiliar with those games to be able to say how they
      implemented the rules.  They might not even be based on the AD&D ruleset
      for all I know.


  Q:  Why don't my stats improve when I get a level?

  A:  Stats such as Strength and Dexterity are considered "set" when you start
      your adventure.  Other stats such as HP and THAC0 improve as you go up
      in level.  This is a more realistic (though I use that term loosely)
      system than most of the others out there in which your stats improve
      upon every level up.  Killing monsters doesn't make you stronger,
      smarter, or faster, it merely gives the experience allowing you to kill
      monsters easier.


  Q:  I have a magic item, but I don't know what it does? How can I get it
      IDENTIFIED?

  A:  Three ways:

      1.) Lore. (At least in BG1, IWD1, BG2 and PST) All characters have a
          certain Lore skill that is based on class/levels and int/wis. Bards
          get the most while fighters get the least. Every item has a lore
          value. (which you don't know) If your character's Lore is equal to
          the item's Lore, the item is identified for free. (usually done with
          a right-click in the inventory screen)

      2.) The Identify spell. In Baldur's Gate, right click the item, click
          Identify, and by Scroll (if you have one) or by Spell (if you have it
          memorized). Only done by wizards.

      3.) At stores. The most common way in all games, all stores will IDENTIFY
          items for you for a fee.


  Q:  I'm stuck in [game], where is the [whatever]?

  A:  Of the games listed, I have made only 5 walkthroughs, Dungeon Hack,
      Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate II and Planescape: Torment.
      If your question isn't about one of those games, and has nothing to do
      with the general rules system, don't ask.


  Q:  In [game] the rules are different than you say here.  What gives?

  A:  Not every game has all the rules, and often they change them to fit
      within the confines of their game better.  These are the 2nd Edition
      AD&D Rules.  Whether the game makers adhered to these rules is another
      matter.


  Q:  Where can I get any of these old games, like Dungeon Hack or Pool of
      Radiance?

  A:  Try the Interplay Forgotten Realms Archives Silver Edition.  I can't
      find any place online to buy this, but it might pop up on eBay or
      another auction site.

      Just don't expect Baldur's Gate style action, these games are quite
      primitive.

      I do not know where you could get any of the other games.
